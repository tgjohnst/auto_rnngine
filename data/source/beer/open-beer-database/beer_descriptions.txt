Our take on a classic summer ale.  A toast to weeds, rays, and summer haze.  A light, crisp ale for mowing lawns, hitting lazy fly balls, and communing with nature, Hocus Pocus is offered up as a summer sacrifice to clodless days.

Its malty sweetness finishes tart and crisp and is best apprediated with a wedge of orange.

























This full-bodied ale is brewed with roasted malts and a hint of Dark Belgian sugar for a perfectly balanced taste.
We took the traditional IPA, originally shipped from England to India in the 1700's, and made it bolder and more flavorful - American Style. We've added new varieties of highly aromatic American hops to create a distinctive bitterness profile and an incredible hop character.
Ornery Amber is brewed with a blend of the finest European hops and gently roasted malts.
Not quite a stout but definitely no lightweight, Cutthroat Porter is smooth and robust. Inspired by the classic London porters, we use dark roasted malts to create a deep, rich color and flavor that hint at chocolate and coffee. We named it Cutthroat Porter as our tribute to the Colorado state fish - with its own rich heritage and unmistakable dark coloring. And while we're big fans of small batches, here's to the currently threatened Cutthroat population reaching mass quantities.
Maple syrup is added to each barrel of Maple Nut Brown Ale to impart roasted sweetness balancing the nut flavor produced by chocolate malts.








Quelque Chose was launched in January 1996. This versatile beer was specifically developed as a winter beer because, when warmed to 70ÂºC (160ÂºF), it can be taken as a hot drink. On the other hand, on the rocks, it is a wonderful aperitif. The cherries are soaked for months in slightly bitter ale before being blended into the beer. Quelque Chose is made with dark roasted malts, and the end result is something commonly known as an authentic nectar. The most original of the Unibroue line, it is highly appreciated by winter-sports enthusiasts.

Like Hops? You'll like this fire-hued beer. This is the beer I have always dreamed of making.

Without Golden Promise malt, made by family-owned Simpsons Malt, Furious would just be pissed off-ed. From Scotland, this malt is still produced in the tradition of turning over the barley by hand, resulting in a malt that is unsurpassed in its quality. Golden Promise is also used extensively by premium whisky distilleries such as The Macallan. This malt provides the backbone for the intense hop character. Four American hop varieties are used at a rate of over three pounds per barrel. The result is a rich malt sweetness infused with bright hop flavor and aroma from beginning to end. Oh yeah, it's about 6% alcohol and around 100 IBUs.
This beer is an amalgamation of styles; brown/porter/apa. Five distinct malts, including two from Belgium, give this beer added complexity and depth. We also add oatmeal to this beer to give it a smooth texture not usually associated with this type of beer. We add large amounts of American finishing hops to give Bender a citrus hop aroma because... we like hops. This is a session beer weighing in around 5% alcohol and 25 IBUs. Grab one today, we think you will want another!

This fine yeast wheat beer specialty is a refreshing, natural and stimulating beer brand.






















A big malty body from chocolate and roasted malts, well balanced with just the right combination of hops. Robust yet smooth, a true malt-lover's delight.




















By 1915, Bend, Oregon, was alive with the sound of the buzz saw, as two of the country's largest pine sawmills set up shop on the banks of the Deschutes River.  The mills are  gone now, but the smokestacks still stand testament to Bend's humble beginnings. 

Buzzsaw Brown is an easy-drinking beer that is refreshing after a hard dayâ€™s work. The timber mills in Bend may be closed, but whether your adventure includes a day of scaling rock faces, hitting 18 holes or skiing the slopes in spring, Buzzsaw Brown is the perfect end to a fun-filled day.

â€œBuzzsaw Brown is one of my favorite beers,â€ says Deschutes Brewery Brewmaster Larry Sidor. â€œThe unique combination of European and American malts makes it a very food friendly beer that pairs well with a wide variety of flavors.â€

This is one of our rare lagers brewed in the style of the German Heiliges Geist Bock, or Holy Ghost Bock. The name refers to the lighter nature of the beer as opposed to the darker and heavier Doppel Bock and Mai Bock also brewed during the spring in Germany. There is a rich malt flavor, a firm German style lager head, and a clean lagered finish to this beer.  Available on draft or in 12 oz. bottles.

Coopers Dark Ale has no additives and no preservatives.
Cinder Cone Red's diverse selection of hops and barley captivates thirsty palates with its toffee-like flavor, intense citrus aroma and defined bitterness.

Located on the northern slope of Mt. Bachelor, the Cinder Cone was also known as "Red Hill" due to its reddish color that is revealed as the seasons change, the weather warms and the snow melts.  It's spring. Time to get outside.








The Rocky Mountain Goat is no ordinary goat. Just like Odell Red is no ordinary red. 

We took the American-style red to a whole new level by adding a variety of aggressive American hopsâ€”giving this ale a distinctive fresh hop aroma and flavor. 

We think you'll agree this red has some serious kick.


















A sustaining beer that is brewed to comfort in the gusty ides of March and welcome in a wealth of warmer weather.













Looking for something a little different? Brewed with rice and barley malts, Samurai is an easy drinking, unfiltered ale that changes the status quo for unfiltered beers.

We introduced 90 Shilling, our flagship beer, at our opening party in 1989. For a while, we'd been wondering - what would happen if we lightened up the traditional Scottish ale? The result is an irresistibly smooth and delicious medium-bodied amber ale. The name 90 Shilling comes from the Scottish method of taxing beer. Only the highest quality beers were taxed 90 Shillings. A shilling was a British coin used from 1549 to 1982. We think you'll find this original ale brilliantly refreshing, and worth every shilling.
SUNSHINE WHEAT is a great beer for trouncing thirst.  Yet, it has a depth of character that inspires a quiet momentâ€™s reflection. Sunshine Wheat swirls in the mouth with ripples of coriander and orange peel tartness, settling nicely into a tranquil sea of apple and honey tones.  A filtered wheat beer, Sunshine offers a crisp, refreshing alternative to heavier-bodied heffe-weizens.

Ever tried a Skinny Dip? You wouldn't be alone.

Cascade hops frolic with a hint of lime leaf, giving the beer complexity that's surprisingly refreshing.


Our first venture into organically-produced beer, Mothership Wit Organic Wheat Beer elevates the zesty Wit or White beers of Belgium. Our far-flung Beer Rangers affectionately refer to our Fort Collins brewery as the Mothership, a name that conjures images of earth shot from space and the interconnectivity of it all. Mothership Wit is brewed with wheat and barley malt, as well as coriander and orange peel spicing resulting in a balance of citrus and sour flavors held in suspension by a bright burst of carbonation.




















HotShot ESB is an easy-drinking and remarkably smooth Extra Special Bitter, brewed in the classic-English style. More assertively hopped than ordinary bitters, light copper-colored HotShot showcases clean hop flavors, balanced by its slightly fruity nose and light-caramel malt character.

European Strong Lager












































Levity is our lighter take on the amber ale. Munich and honey malts give it a full-bodied flavor and a happy-go-lucky personality. Then we let the finishing hops shine, for a beer that's crisp instead of bitter, as many ambers are. Levity was named by our brewers partly for its light color - and partly for the way it just refuses to take itself too seriously. Hey, we could all use a little levity once in a while.
Light and refreshing, Easy Street Wheat is an unfiltered American-style wheat beer. Leaving in the yeast gives the beer a nice, smooth finish and a slightly citrusy flavor. Easy Street Wheat gets its name by brewers "taking it easy" and not filtering the beer. However, for ultimate enjoyment, we encourage you to work just a little harder in pouring it: just pour 2/3 of the beer into a glass, swirl what's left to stir up the yeast, then pour the rest and enjoy.
Boulevard Pale Ale is a smooth, fruity, well-balanced beer with year-round appeal. A variety of caramel malts impart a rich flavor and amber color, while liberal use of whole hops adds zest and aroma. Pale Ale is the first beer we brewed, and continues to be a perennial favorite.

An arabier is a pure malt beer 8Â°vol/alc brewed with flower Nugget-hops from Poperinge. It has the special dry-hopping taste and aroma, so appreciated by beer lovers all over the world. It is one of the two main beers from De Dolle Brouwers throughout the year. Aging time is limited due to the fact that hop bitterness is declining with the time. Store arabier cool and dark and serve cool at 10Â°C. Cheers!







LOOK:
Kwak is recognisable by its deep bright amber colour and a dense, creamy coloured head. The pale wood of the glass holder makes a pleasant contrast with the beer.

SMELL:
You will smell a mellow, fruity and malty aroma with a slightly spicy character (coriander, hops). Additional earthy and very subtle aromas of banana and perhaps also a whiff of pineapple or mango in the background.

TASTE:
Discover a very mellow, fruity attack, a nougat-like solidity, and a slightly spicy character with hints of liquorice passing into a warm finish that reminds you of caramelised banana. The bitterness always remains in the background but in the end emerges delicately.

Reddish-brown colour, with a very compact head and an aroma of figs, feels like honey in the mouth. The alcohol profile is a major component in the flavour of this rich ale. It is very similar to 6 and 8, but has much more of everything. Some may find the high alcohol content to be disagreeable.

An artisan farmhouse ale that is golden, naturally cloudy, bottle conditioned and dry hopped for a perfectly refreshing balance of spicy malts, hops and yeast.

Our American-style Barleywine undergoes a three hour boil to intensify the caramel malts and the enormous Pacific Northwest hop charge. The result is a rich, estery brew with toffee notes and citrus hop flavors layered throughout. Enjoy this brew fresh today or lay it down for aging to see how the flavors of each vintage evolve.


Dark-ruby, almost black-colored and streaked with fine top-fermenting yeast, this beer has a compact and persistent head. This is a very intense wheat doppelbock with a complex spicy chocolate-like arome with a hint of banana and raisins. On the palate, you experience a soft touch and on the tongue it is very rich and complex, though fresh with a hint of caramel. It finishes in a rich soft and lightly bitter impression.
Our Trippel Belgian Style Ale (pronounced triple) opens with a bold blast of hops that slowly gives way to the fruity esters implied by our Belgian yeast strain. The Three Graces hand-painted on the label are Zeusâ€™s daughters Aglaia (splendor), Euphrosyne (mirth) and Thalia (good cheer). In the Belgian tradition of brewing singles, doubles and triples, Trippel is the strongest with the longest fermentation. Remarkably smooth and complex, our bottle-conditioned Trippel is spiced with a trace of coriander.

Winner of four World Beer Cup medals and eight medals at the Great American Beer Fest, Abbey Belgian Ale is the Mark Spitz of New Belgiumâ€™s lineup - but it didnâ€™t start out that way. When Jeff and Kim first sampled the beer at the Lyons Folks Fest, reviews were mixed at best. One of founder Jeffâ€™s first two Belgian style homebrews (along with Fat Tire), Abbey is a Belgian dubbel (or double) brewed with six different malts and an authentic Belgian yeast strain. Abbey is bottle-conditioned, weighs in at 7.0% alcohol by volume, and pairs well with chocolate (or boldly served by itself) for dessert.


An amber pale ale dry hopped with a blend of American hops.

Brewed in the Franco-Belgian tradition of strong golden ales.  Spicy and peppery with a gentle hop bouquet and the beguiling influence of wild yeast.
An artisan amber ale brewed in the Flanders tradition.  Deep amber with earthy caramel, spice, and sour fruit notes developed through natural barrel aging.  Unfiltered, unpasteurized and blended from barrels ranging in age from two to ten months.

This Fresh Hop Pale Ale is all about celebrating the hop harvest in the fall.  Fresh picked hops have to be added to the brew immediately and in abundance.  Roughly 270 pounds of Crystal hops from Doug Weathers' farm outside Salem, Oregon will be added to the 50 barrel batch in addition to some dry kilned whole flower hops.  That adds up to approximately 5.5 pounds of hops per barrel brewed.  Another deliciously interesting beer in our Bond Street Series.


Great Divideâ€™s award-winning Hibernation Ale is Coloradoâ€™s original strong ale â€“ it has been our winter seasonal each year since 1995. Since that time, Hibernation has become the most sought-after winter beer in Colorado. Hibernationâ€™s massive flavors are so intense that it requires over three months of aging each year. Each summer, while our brewers are still spending their weekends in flip-flops and shorts, they prepare for Julyâ€™s Hibernation brewing schedule.

We cellar Hibernation until late October, when it reaches the peak of perfection. This lengthy aging process gives Hibernation its revered malty richness, complex hop profile and hearty warming character, which is perfect right out of the bottle or cellared for longer periods of time. Hibernation is a lively treat that really beats the winter chill. This scrumptious, collectible, and imminently cellarable ale is only available for six weeks each year, from November 1 to December 15.  Hibernation Ale is the perfect gift or accompaniment to your winter festivities.

Pull on your wool socks and crack open a 2Â° Below Ale. This tasty winter warmer started life as a small batch beer brewed for the Al Johnson Uphill Downhill â€“ a telemark ski race in Crested Butte, Colorado. The Uphill Downhill celebrates the exploits of Al Johnson, letter carrier extraordinaire, who delivered mail by ski in the late 1800â€™s. Dry hopping during fermentation creates a floral nose with a hint of pepper and spicy, subtle undertones. 2Â° Below provides a bright, hoppy palate and a cheery warm afterglow.


Hoppier, maltier and with more alcohol than a standard IPA, Hercules Double IPA definitely is not for the faint of heart. Hercules Double IPA is, however, an elixir fit for the gods. A brash but creamy wonder, Hercules pours a deep orange-coppery color, forming substantial lace in the glass. Hercules Double IPA delivers a huge amount of piney, floral, and citrusy hop aroma and flavor from start to finish. A hefty backbone of nutty, toffee-like malt character balances Herculesâ€™ aggressive, punchy hop profile.
The September hop harvest is a once-a-year opportunity to brew with fresh hops, also called â€œwet hops.â€ Given the perishable nature of just-harvested hop cones, they are shipped overnight to Great Divide shortly after harvest. The morning of the scheduled hop delivery in Denver, Great Divideâ€™s brewers begin brewing Fresh Hop and are ready to hop the beer just as the fresh hops are delivered.

Using fresh hops is a big endeavor, requiring four to five times the volume of hops compared to the usual process of using pelletized hops. This complex process brings impressive results: Fresh Hop is an American-Style Pale Ale with moderate hop bitterness marked by a unique and intensely grassy hop flavor and aroma. Fresh Hop is a superbly refreshing, medium bodied, light-copper colored pale ale.


After several months of experimentation, energy and obsession, Deschutes Breweryâ€™s brewers have triumphed once again.  Inversion I.P.A.'s trio of American hops delivers an over-the-top nose with hints of orange and grapefruit.  Inversion is then dry-hopped for seven days resulting in an added hoppy kick.  To balance the hop character, Deschutesâ€™ brewers used crystal and caraston malts that weave throughout the beer providing soft, complex caramel flavors. 

Just like clear days up on the mountain, Inversion I.P.A. will deliver a path to higher ground.  Inversion I.P.A. is a phenomenal NW-style I.P.A., beckoning all beer drinkers and enticing I.P.A. lovers to invert their world and find clarity above the routine of the everyday.







Climb on in and grab a paddle. Our first foray into lagered beers, Blue Paddle Pilsener-Lager, is a Czech style pilsener with a refreshing crispness from noble hops and a rich, malty finish. â€˜Blue Paddleâ€™ refers to the implement our warehouse managerâ€™s Grandma once used to lovingly paddle his a** when she caught him stealing sips of her beer. With more body than a traditional Belgian pils, Blue Paddle is reflective of Europeâ€™s finest pilseners.







La Folie Wood-Aged Biere, is our original wood-conditioned beer, resting in French Oak barrels between one and three years before being bottled. . Peter Bouckaert, came to us from Rodenbach â€“ home of the fabled sour red. Our La Folie emulates the spontaneous fermentation beers of Peterâ€™s beloved Flanders with sour apple notes, a dry effervescence, and earthy undertones. New in 2010, we'll do a single bottling of La Folie for the year. Collect the 22oz unique to 2010 designed bottle and start a yearly wood-aged collection of goodness.
The absolute top quality in the hierarchy of the St. Bernardus beers. It is also the beer with the highest alcohol content (10.50 %).

This beer has a beautiful round froth due to the second fermentation with a taste that creates a perfect balance between sweet and sour.




Schwarzbier means "black beer" in German. It is a medium-bodied, malt-accented dark brew, very opaque and deep-sepia in color, with a chewy texture and a firm, creamy, long-lasting head. In spite of its dark color, it comes across as a soft and elegant brew that is rich, mild, and surprisingly balanced. It never tastes harsh, toasty or acrid. The beer is often referred to as a Schwarzpils, a "black Pils," but, unlike a blond Pils, which can be assertively bitter, the hop bitterness in Schwarzbier is always gentle and subdued.

In a glass, Schwarzbier looks much like a British dark ale, but looks can be deceiving. Schwarzbier, unlike a British ale, has a clean lager taste that leaves next to no perception of fruitiness on the palate. Instead, Schwarzbier produces very mild, almost bittersweet, notes of chocolate, coffee, and vanilla. Like most traditional German lagers, Schwarzbier has a malty middle, but the sweetness is never cloying or overpowering. The beer is moderately to well attenuated and the finish tends to be dry. Its alcohol level by volume is in the range of 4.5 to 5%, rarely higher. To accentuate the Schwarzbier's dark elegance and appealing head, always serve it in a tall, fluted or tulip-shaped glass.
This beer, with high fermentation, has a pale amber colour and a flowery, fruity taste with a harmonious balance between sweet and sour (8% alcohol content). 
This beer has a thick and vivid froth and strikes by its balanced taste with a delicate bitterness.



eddish colour, almost like autumn leaves, very consistent texture with a slightly spicy aroma and an intense taste of caramel, fruit, and hints of raisins. It is only brewed about once per year, representing approximately 1% of total beer production, thus is quite difficult to obtain.

Was first brewed in 1934 and the recipe has not changed since 1956. It is made with pale candy sugar and has a very pale color produced from a mash of light pilsener malts. Styrian Goldings hops are used along with some German varieties and the classic Saaz pilsener hop. After a long secondary fermentation, the Tripel Westmalle is bottled with a dose of sugar and yeast. This beer holds up well in the bottle over time and seems to soften with age.





































































































































































































































Black as the darkest night, rich as the most decadent dessert, Terminator is for the true stout lover.

OUR FLAGSHIP BEER, the one for which we're known throughout the Puget Sound. Columbus hops impart intense bitterness with flavors of grapefruit and a hint of cedar.









































Fish Tale Organic India Pale Ale is a medium-bodied beer with a rich golden color. The organic pale and crystal malts lay down a firm malt body. This provides the backbone for an assertive hop profile featuring organic Pacific Gem. The moment the Mighty Fish Brewers sampled this pungent and resinous New Zealand hop, they knew it would be perfect for their Organic I.P.A. The result: A Cascadian treasure.

Medium-bodied with an appealing amber hue, this is the First Ale of the Republic. Its organic pale, Munich, and crystal malts create a gentle sweet character that is difficult to resist.  From organic Hallertauer hops come a zesty flavor and aroma that beautifully balance Organic Amber's malt profile. The result: Truly delicious ale that salutes organic farmers and all the goodness they bring to our tables.

Traditionally, Imperial Stouts, the biggest and boldest of all stouts, were brewed with massive amounts of roasted malts and hops, resulting in a velvety smooth but robust beer characterized by high alcohol content and extremely high hop bitterness. Meeting the challenge of this aggressive, challenging beer style, Great Divideâ€™s Yeti Imperial Stout is an onslaught of the senses. An almost viscous, inky-black brew, Yeti opens with a massive, roasty, chocolate, coffee malt flavor that eventually gives way to rich toffee and burnt caramel notes. Packed with an enormous quantity of American hops, Yetiâ€™s hop profile reveals a slightly citrusy, piney, and wonderfully dry hoppy finish.



















Yellowish-brown colour, with a more pronounced aroma, more fruits and a slight amount of Demi-Sec. This variety constitutes the largest proportion of production.

La Terrible is a dark brown beer on lees and is part of a collection of exotic and refined Unibroue beers brewed using 100% natural raw materials. It may be drunk as an aperitif or as an after dinner digestive. It is equally a perfect accompaniment to the above-mentioned dishes or a pleasant alternative to coffee.


The distinctive hop character of our 5 Barrel Pale Ale is due to the extraction of essential oils from select hops. We treat 5 Barrel Pale Ale to an infusion of fresh whole hop flowers in the Hop Back and the Fermentor, as well as four hop additions during the kettle boil. We like how this gives the beer a fresh, lively flavor and aroma.



This authentic Abbey Ale is based on the recipe perfected centuries ago by the monks of Abbey Du Val-Dieu.



















â€œIf One is Good, Then Two is Better!â€ Our Moylander Double IPA is fat and resiny, with aggresive and excessive hops swinging on on an enormous malt backbone like naughty monkeys on a vine.

No lightweight, Big Daddy I.P.A tips the scales with a huge hop flavor and a clean, dry finish that leaves the scene without a trace.
Traditionally India Pale Ales, the hoppiest of all pales, were brewed with more alcohol and large quantities of hops in order to survive the lengthy ocean journey from the U.K. to India. Unlike our brewing forefathers, Great Divide enjoys the modern benefits of refrigeration and we donâ€™t have any plans to ship Titan IPA to India. Instead, we brew Titan IPA for hop disciples â€“ independent beer drinkers seeking out robust, flavorful beers characterized by their abundance of hops flavor, aroma and bitterness. As a big, aggressively hopped India Pale Ale, Titan IPA fills this bill â€“ beginning with piney hop aromas and citrus hop flavors, and finishing with a rich, malty sweetness that is carefully balanced with crisp hop bitterness.

This lovely beer won the Soil Associationâ€™s top prize in 2002 and a silver medal in 2006.

This is a beer of principle.



This is a hoppy IPA. Did I say hops? Your brewer is a hop head! This is a full bodied beer using American grains. The goal was to create a base for showing off the unique floral qualities of two Pacific Northwest hops, Columbus and Cascade. Columbus is a new hybrid High Alpha Acid hop used mostly for bittering, but used heavily as an aromatic in this strong brew. Cascade is the balance that ties the malt and bittering hops together. It is a true specialty ale and is our brewer's statement on this style.

Born of a flood and centuries-old Belgian text, 1554 Enlightened Black Ale uses a light lager yeast strain and dark chocolaty malts to redefine what dark beer can be. In 1997, a Fort Collins flood destroyed the original recipe our researcher, Phil Benstein, found in the library. So Phil and brewmaster, Peter Bouckaert, traveled to Belgium to retrieve this unique style lost to the ages. Their first challenge was deciphering antiquated script and outdated units of measurement, but trial and error (and many months of in-house sampling) culminated in 1554, a highly quaffable dark beer with a moderate body and mouthfeel.

Lest we forget Aunt Cal, an early resident of Lake Mills.  Local history remembers her for blindly running into a hitching post and saying, "Excuse me, Dr. Dodge!"  It was said that she was an old sweetheart of the famous American poet, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.  And she still had the love letters to prove it!  Sadly, Aunt Cal never wed.

Brewed in the fall to help you survive our Wisconsin winters.

SMELL:
Very refined and complex. Hints of vanilla mixed with citrus aromas.

TASTE:
Tripel Karmeliet has not only the lightness and freshness of wheat, but also the creaminess of oats together with a spicy lemony almost quinine
dryness.

Our interpretation of a legendary style ale is not for the timid. Assertively hoppy and dangerously seductive. A skillful blend of three premium barley malts with generous amounts of Northern Brewer and Cascade Hops creates a special ale to satisfy even the most demanding palate.

Four types of malted barley, including a specially roasted Belgium barley make up the grain bill. Centennial, Sterling, and Amarillo hops provide the big hoppy flavor. Double dry-hopped, once with raw Centennial hops and once with raw Amarillo hops present this beer's huge hop aroma.

ndia Pale Ale is a style of beer that was developed in England during the period of the British Empire. It is derived from bitter ales but contains even more alcohol and hops. This helped preserve the beer on its long sea journey around Cape Hope to India.

British troops returning from India brought their love of this beer back with them so breweries began brewing it for the home market as well. Sadly, the style had mostly died out in England by the late twentieth century.

American home brewers began to brew I.P.A. because of their love for the intense hoppiness of the style. In time American I.P.A.s became much more aggressively bitter and hoppy than their historical predecessors.

Big Eye I.P.A. is our version of this wonderful style.  American Centennial hops are  used exclusively to bitter, flavor, finish, and dry hop the Big Eye. Its full hop flavor is guaranteed to please the palate of the true hop head.


















































































Emphasizing that complexity of character can arise from simple elements, this ale is made with three malts and one hop. Its light amber color and slightly spicy malt character are derived from the use of German Dark Munich Malt and Rye Malt respectively. North American 2-row barley combines with the other grains to lay the foundation for the hop onslaught to come. Summit hops are used exclusively in the boil for bitterness, flavor and aroma but it doesnâ€™t end there. Post-fermentation dry hopping allows the 9.5% ABV monstrosity to gently coax the citrus rind and grapefruit aroma to join the 100 IBUs already present. This beer should greet you with a pungent citrus blast, provide a spicy yet round middle and finish with a brisk, clean bitterness.






























Dark Island is an iconic beer: a standard-bearer for traditional Scottish ales. In cask, this beer has twice won CAMRAâ€™s Champion Beer of Scotland.

The Finches will get you if you donâ€™t watch out!" In the early days of southern Wisconsin, falling into the clutches of the "Fighting Finches" was the ultimate threat. Moses Finch fathered 21 offspring whose most notable talents were stealing horses and robbing stagecoaches.

The Finches are long gone, but their legend lives on. So enjoy a pint of our Fighting Finches Bockâ€¦ or you better watch out, â€˜cause the Finches are gonna get you!
The legend of Tyranena began 3,000 years ago, with a group of pyramids and effigy mounds constructed in a remote valley formed by a vast, slow-moving glacier.  

Today, these ancient "stone tepees" lie 60 feet below the surface of Rock Lake in Jefferson County, Wisconsin.  No one is certain how or why they were built, but many have speculated on their origin, purpose and the people who built them.  

We invite you to develop your own theories on the legend and mystery of Tyranena while enjoying a Stone Tepee Pale Ale.

TrÃ¶egs Breweryâ€™s Flagship beer, HopBack Amber Ale derives its name from a vessel in the brewhouse called a hopback.

This vessel adds more time and more hop character that creates a fresh, spicy taste and rich caramel note that defines this signature ale.

Celabrator, Illuminator, Subliminator... In the spirit of the tradition we give you the Troegenator to provide warmth and richness through the early spring months.

Coors beer, first introduced by Adolph Coors in April, 1874, is brewed in the Rockies for a uniquely crisp, clean and drinkable "Mile High Taste."

During World War II, Coors aided the war effort by setting aside half its beer for sale to the military.  When the service men and women returned home to states outside of Coors' original 11-state marketing region, they spread the word about the beer's taste and quality -- which became known as the "Coors Mystique."

Prior to its national expansion in the 1980s, Coors' limited distribution left consumers in the eastern U.S. wanting a taste of the Rocky Mountains' finest beer. President Gerald Ford was known to take several cases of Coors on his Air Force One during return trips to the White House.

In September 1893, Coors competed for the first time at the Chicago World's Fair and won awards for brilliancy, flavor, chemical analysis and commercial flavor.  The award-winning legacy of the brew continues and in recent years Coors beer has won a number of honors at beer festivals.

Blue Moon Belgian White, Belgian-style wheat ale, is a refreshing, medium-bodied, unfiltered Belgian-style wheat ale spiced with fresh coriander and orange peel for a uniquely complex taste and an uncommonly smooth finish.

The name "Belgian White" is a reference to the cloudy white, opaque appearance of the beer. "Belgian White" also refers to the style of beer, which has been brewed in Belgium for about 300 years. This type of ale is brewed with malt, wheat and oats. It is unfiltered, which allows protein and yeast to remain suspended in the beer and creates the cloudy appearance. This also adds to the smoothness and full body of the beer.

Putting a new twist on the lime ritual, Blue Moon is traditionally served with a slice of orange.  Blue Moon was launched in 1995.
Killian's Irish Red is a traditional lager with an authentic Irish heritage, based on the Killian family's recipe created for the Killian's brewery in Enniscorthy, Ireland in 1864. Coors acquired the rights to brew and market the product in America and Killian's was introduced to the U.S. in 1981.

Killian's Irish Red derives its distinctive red-amber color and taste from a special caramel malt that has been roasted at a high temperature longer and more slowly than most malts. There are no coloring agents or artificial additives used in brewing Killian's. The brew is known for its rich amber color and thick, creamy head.

"Not your Dad's Wimpy 30 Weight is how our original label used to describe this massive chewy and thick beer. Code named by our brewers-"The Big Black Nasty," this is monstrous dark ale is brewed to no particular style. Thick and sludgy like oil from the crankcase of a wheat threshing combine, Old Viscosity blurs the boundaries of Porter, Stout, Old Ale and Barleywines.

It then joins another 20% Barrel Aged Old Viscosity (from a previous batch) that has been aging in bourbon barrels. The blend of the two beers yields an incredibly rich and luscious ale that reveals chocolate and cocoa notes melded to silky body of burnt wood, vanilla and ash.

The Mighty Fish Brewers first produced Ten Squared Anniversary Ale to celebrate Fish Brewing Companyâ€™s tenth anniversary. The ale was so good and the response to it so overwhelmingly positive that it has become the crown jewel of REEL ALEs. Ten different hops: Horizon, Chinook, Columbus, Willamette, Tradition, Northern Brewer, Santiam, Tettnanger, Cascade and Golding, in the order of their use -- give Ten Squared a unique hop character which has to be tasted to be believed. 

Even with 100 IBUs, this brew sports a strong malt backbone. Two-row Pale, Caramel 40, Caramel 75, Special B and Aromatic malts impart remarkable balance for such a hop monster. This is smooth ale with surprising similarities to ten year old malt whiskey. Produced for the holidays, 10 102 Anniversary Ale is usually available into late spring.
Samuel Adams Boston LagerÂ® is the best example of the fundamental characteristics of a great beer, offering a full, rich flavor that is both balanced and complex. It is brewed using a decoction mash, a time consuming, traditional four vessel brewing process discarded by many contemporary brewers. This process brings forth a rich sweetness from the malt that makes it well worth the effort. Samuel Adams Boston LagerÂ® also uses only the finest of ingredients including two row barley, as well as German Noble aroma hops. The exclusive use of two row barley not only imparts a full, smooth body but also gives the beer a wide spectrum of malt flavor ranging from slightly sweet to caramel to slightly roasted. The Noble hops varieties, Hallertau Mittelfruh and Tettnang Tettnanger, add a wide range of floral, piney and citrus notes, which are present from the aroma, through the flavor, to the lingering smooth finish. We take great pride in the Noble hops used in our beers. They are hand selected by Jim Koch and our other brewers from the world's oldest hops growing area. Among the world's most expensive, they cost twenty times as much as other hops.
Intense and warming, a meal in a bottle.
One can not help but appreciate Samuel AdamsÂ® Double Bock's huge malt character. We use an enormous amount of malt, half a pound per bottle, to brew this intensely rich lager. Its deep brown-ruby color is all made in the kettle - no black malt is used, resulting in a rich sweetness that is free of the rough taste of burnt malt. All that remains is the velvet smooth flavor and mouthfeel of the two row malt. Samuel AdamsÂ® Double Bock's intense malt character is balanced with a subtle piney, citrus hop note from the German Noble hops.

Due to legal restrictions, Samuel AdamsÂ® Double Bock can not be sold in the states of Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, Louisiana, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, and West Virginia.
right and citrusy, brewed with mysterious grains of paradise.
Samuel Adams® Summer Ale is an American wheat ale. This summer seasonal uses malted wheat as well as lemon zest and grains of paradise, a rare pepper from Africa first used as a brewing spice in the 13th Century to create a crisp and spicy flavor and body. The ale fermentation imparts a background tropical fruit note reminiscent of mangos and peaches. All of these come together to create a quenching, clean finishing beer perfect for those warm Summer days
A smooth, refined version of a classic ale.
Samuel AdamsÂ® Boston Ale was first brewed to celebrate the opening of our Boston Brewery. Like Samuel Adams Boston LagerÂ®, it was an old family recipe that was rescued by Jim Koch from his father's attic. Samuel AdamsÂ® Boston Ale, a Stock Ale, has a complex, caramel malt character balanced with distinct spicy and herbal hop notes. Our proprietary ale yeast imparts a variety of fruit and ester notes in both the nose and flavor which are indicative of the style.
When one sees a beer with a darker complexion these days, more often than not it
Bold and rich, with a touch of holiday spice
The first thing one notices in a Samuel Adams® Winter Lager is its color: the deep brown of winter. Then comes the magical aroma which promises something special on the tongue. The warm aroma of cinnamon and ginger which blends with the roasty sweetness of the malted barley and hint of citrus from the orange peel. And after that first sip the promise is fulfilled. On the palate Samuel Adams® Winter Lager is rich and full bodied, robust and warming, a wonderful way to enjoy the cold evenings that come with this season.
Merry Monks' Ale is a Belgian style Abby Trippel without limitation.  This style was created by Trappist Monks in Belgium over 500 years ago. To be true to the style, Merry Monks' Ale is bottle conditioned. This means we add a bit of sugar and yeast just prior to bottling. This imparts a special effervescence to the beer, a creamier carbonation, and also extends the shelf life. The on-going fermentation inside the bottle will change the character of the beer as it ages, and you'll find it becomes dryer with age. You may want to lay down a few bottles for future evaluation. We suggest storing at cellar temperatures -around 55 degrees F- and away from light.

When you try this beer you're in for a unique treat. The special effervescence and creaminess are immediately apparent when pouring. The Pilsner malts combined with the Belgian yeast strains  yield a remarkable and complex flavor- perhaps you'll note subtle hints of fruit or spice. The flavor is nicely balanced and the finish moderate to dry , begging for the next sip.

You might ask why we go through all this trouble and expense for just a beer, but one taste and you'll know the Merry Monks' Ale (9.3% ABV) will more than complement any meal it accompanies. Enjoyed best around 48 degrees F, it also makes a fine after-dinner drink.
At Weyerbacher we've created a Winter Ale that is a must for any malty beer lover. Winner of a Silver Medal in the 1998 World Beer Championships, Weyerbacher Winter Ale is brewed with deep-roasted chocolate malt. The taste predominates with a warm, roasty flavor, balanced out with a slightly dry finish. It's smooth but not cloying, with a warming belt of alcohol (5.6% ABV).

Although winter ales predate history, they are believed to have their origin in the pagan celebrations of winter solstice. Later, when monasteries produced the local brew, winter ales were made each year to commemorate the birth of Christ. Back then, winter ales were brewed full-bodied as a source of nutrition for the upcoming winter months. Today, winter ales are typified by their seasonality, their rich, malty flavors and by their deep, dark coloration.

Generally available November-March, Weyerbacher Winter Ale is the perfect libation for a winter meal, with good friends, or beside a warm fire fending off a cold winter night.
AutumnFest is Weyerbacher's own unique twist on the German Oktoberfest style. Copper-amber in color, AutumnFest is made with Vienna and Munich malts for that authentic, Bavarian easy drinking taste.  Each sip imparts a wonderful roastiness of malt on the tongue followed by a smooth, consistent finish.  Wonderfully balanced with a clean, velvety, slightly fruity taste, AutumnFest is the perfect beer for the Fall- a nice transition between the lighter beers of summer and the darker, heavier winter brews. It's a favorite of many Weyerbacher aficionados, who anticipate the end of summer with this wonderful beer. 

   Weyerbacher AutumnFest ( ABV 5.4%) is generally available in stores August through December.  Pick up a case to celebrate the change of seasons. Prost!
Coming in at an ABV of 7.0%, Our Black Hole satisfies the transition from dark ale to stout. We think of this as slightly "Porter-ish" with a strong malt body and a very light hop finish. This is brewed year round and is available in Pennsylvania in the regular Variety Pack.  This will help the ale drinker among us maintain their own balance!
Clean, refreshing and perhaps just a bit tart, our brewers developed Weyerbacher Blanche just after their trip to Belgium during the winter of 2000.  Blanche, meaning "white", takes its name from the whitish haze in this pale gold brew, which is a result of the raw wheat and wheat malts used to brew this Belgian-style beer. 

In 2002, Blanche was named as Best of the Mid-Atlantic/Southeast in the Belgian Specialty category at the US Beer Tasting Championships.

White beers are well known as the principal product from Hoegaarden, a small town in a wheat-growing region east of Brussels.  Light, cloudy and smooth, Weyerbacher Blanche brings you authentic Belgian-style flavor along with microbrewed quality and freshness.

Blanche is a thirst quenching beer that combines character and flavor with a moderate alcohol content.  Just try a bottle.  In the nose you'll notice spiciness from the coriander seeds and dried curacao orange peels added during the boil.  In the mouth you'll find a mild and refreshing ale with a hint of dryness from the wheat ingredients.  A clean finish follows with just a hint of tart spiciness.
First released in March 2007,  Blasphemy is our award winning QUAD aged in bourbon barrels.  But not overaged, so we've picked up gentle vanilla oaky notes which complement rather than supercede the complex qualities that already make QUAD such an incredible beer.  Expected to be an annual Spring seasonal, supplies are limited.  ABV is 11.8%.
At Weyerbacher, we prefer to brew things true to European style guidelines. Consequently our barley wine is  on the malty side, yet not  overly sweet. Notes of date or perhaps fig on the palate follow a pleasurably malty aroma to your taste buds. The finish is warm and fruity, and begs for the next sip.

Enjoy Blithering Idiot in a brandy snifter or wine glass, preferably in front of the fire, or accompanying a literary classic. This is the finest life has to offer and should be treated as such. Moments of reflection make all the toil worthwhile, and Blithering Idiot is for moments like these. Share it with your family over the holiday dinner. Lay a few down, aging only helps a barley wine develop more class. At 11.1 % ABV (alcohol by volume) this fine ale will keep for years. Our expected maximum shelf-life is 2 to 3 years. Although it might see a decade, beyond the 3rd year most barley-wines have a tendency to decrease in complexity, so don't wait too long
Decadence is our Tenth Anniversay spiced amber ale.  This is a very limited production, brewed only once, to celebrate ten fantastic years in business.  This ale weighs in at 13% ABV and is a fantastic sipper, especially after dinner or consider paring it with a good book on a cool fall evening.  Decadence is brewed with honey, cardamom spice and gentian (a rare botanical!)  This ale is very unique and will develop finer character when aged at cellar temperatures.
Pours a very deep black with a pleasant aroma and a thick brown head.  It has the usual coffee taste you would expect with a hint of chocolate.  There is quite a lot of carbonation but is very drinkable.
Double Simcoe IPA, 9.0% abv, is our incredible reward for Hopheads seeking over the top flavor in a Double IPA, without the harshness. Brewed  with Simcoe hops, developed and trademarked by Select Botanicals Group, LLC, in the year 2000. This hybrid hops was created to allow maximum aromatic oils, along with low cohumulone(harshness) levels, so that brewers can really load up a lot of 'em in a beer and not have any harshness. The piney, citrusy notes are all here, and in a very clean (non-harsh) way, as well as having an aroma with impact. Introduced by Weyerbacher in 2005 originally as a seasonal, this brew has garnered numbers so high on Beer Advocate, and been in such high demand by consumers,  we decided to add it to our year-round line-up in March 2007. Check it out, and you'll soon see why everyone's talking about it.
Our Eleventh anniversy ale, released in July 2006 only is a Triple IPA made exclusively with Phoenix hops. 11.7% abv make this Triple IPA powerful, but the Phoenix hops keep it smooth.  Phoenix is another one of those hops with low cohumulone levels, which means  when used in very large quantities (as we do in Eleven) the hops flavor is very smooth, not a hint of harshness for the enormous amounts of hops in the brew.  As with all of our Anniversay ales, this one will age fantastically and will never be made again, as each anniversary is an entirely different brew.
This incredibly intriguing Imperial Stout is made by aging our Old Heathen in some very famous Oak barrels that were used for aging bourbon! What do we have when we are done? A stout whose very essence has been enhanced. A stout whose complexity has been increased. A stout with notes of Oak, whiskey and vanilla melding together to create a new sensation. Have we gone too far this time? We don't think so. Heresy is a step above and a leap beyond the extraordinary. Taste it and see what everyone is talking about. 8.0% ABV
Hops Infusion is loaded with piney, citrusy notes, much hops complexity, and a strong foundation of malt underneath it all.. Glowing a deep amber color, Hops Infusion is brewed with seven types of hops. Simcoe, Magnum, Cascade, Liberty, Saaz, Fuggles and E. Kent Goldings give this beer the complexity that's so interesting. Our brewers intention on Hops Infusion was to create a complexity of hops flavor and aromas, not found in any other beer.

Originally developed for our BrewPub (no longer open), Hops Infusion was ahead of its time in 1998, but eventually became over shadowed by plethora of entries from other brewers in the India Pale Ale category, with everyone pushing the envelope on hops content more and more. So, in late 2005 we redesigned this beer with an entirely new recipe and new packaging as well. The results are unmistakable, Hops Infusion is clearly a leading IPA once again.

We brew Hops Infusion (6.2% ABV, 1.068 OG) all year 'round. So if your local beer store doesn't have it, tell 'em to get moving!
House Ale, our 4.5% session ale, was first brewed in 2006.  Our goal was to brew a beer that was a little bit lower in alcohol, but did not lack for body and flavor. We're sure you'll agree, that's just what we achieved with this tasty brew.  Brewed with Pale, Caramunich, and Carapils malt for flavor and body, then hopped exclusively with expensive Tettnang hops, a very delicate, delicious hops that perfectly fits this beer with just the right snap of flavor.   Available only in Pennsylvania, in our Variety Pack Case.
Yes that's right!  The mother of all Pumpkin Ales is currently in transit to our wholesalers and should be out on shelves around mid-September.  This 8.0% ABV pumpkin ale is heartier, spicier, and more "caramelly" and "pumpkiny" than its faint brethren!  
  Perfect finisher on a cool autumn night, or match it up with a slice of pumpkin pie and fresh whipped cream.  
  If you don't agree this is the mother of all pumpkin ales, then you just don't like mothers!
Insanity, just released this past November, 2004, is Weyerbacher's latest creation in the world of cutting edge beers. Insanity is made by aging our perfectly balanced Blithering Idiot Barleywine in  oak bourbon casks. This incredible combination creates a melange of flavors such as malt, dates, oak, vanilla, and bourbon just to name a few.

  Insanity is 11.1% ABV. It is best enjoyed in a brandy snifter and served at 45-50 degrees F.
Muse, a Farmhouse Ale,  is brewed "somewhat" in the tradition of the style, but it has Weyerbacher fingerprints all over it! Made with Pale malt, a little carapils, raw wheat and raw oats, this warm weather seasonal is dry and ever so slightly tart on the pallet from the wheat and oats. At 6.2% abv, its a bit higher than your strictly traditional farmhouse, but not out of the realm, really. The wheat and oats makes the mouthfeel silky and light at the same time.  They also bring some cloudiness to the brew, but don't be afraid!  Hopped with Styrian Goldings and finished with Saaz, this beer has a noticable hoppy dryness which makes it a fine thirst quencher, something the original Farmhouse Ales were intended to be, served to workers out in the fields on hot summer days as a restorative.
Fermented with Forbidden Fruit yeast, at a very high temperature (78F), the spiciness developed is entirely from this traditional yeast strain, not from any kettle additions. Unfiltered, to enjoy this natural beauty, and imagine yourself out in the flat fields of Belgium! Cheers!
Rich, velvety and deliciously complex, Old Heathen is a truly distinctive winter warmer. We use seven types of malt and two varieties of hops to bring forth this big brew. Quite robust and roasty on the palate, Old Heathen imperial stout has a wonderfully fruity nose and a moderately dry finish. The taste is highly complex- perhaps you'll even discern notes of espresso or chocolate. 

Old Heathen imperial stout is our interpretation of a beer style that originated in the 18th century. Brewed in England and exported to Germany, Scandinavia and Russia, these beers became fashionable among the members of the Czar's court. In order to survive long voyages they were brewed with high alcohol content to prevent spoilage. And at 8.0% ABV (alcohol by volume) Old Heathen definitely contains a warming belt. You may want to lay down a few bottles for future evaluation- this beer keeps well and will only get better with age.

Like most of our beers, Weyerbacher Old Heathen is a perfect accompaniment to foods. Try it with rich stews, oysters, caviar or roasted meats. Old Heathen is also a perfect companion to chocolate desserts.

Old Heathen is now available year-round.
Prophecy is our third ale to be aged in bourbon barrels. We've taken our Merry Monks' Ale and carefully aged it in bourbon barrels. The result is a fabulous unique ale, softened with hints of vanilla and oak, with an intriguing finish to it. Prophecy is a limited release so when it's here, be sure to grab a case or two to lay away before its gone. 9.3% ABV.
Grand Champion in the 2000, and again in 2004 at United States Beer Tasting Championship, Weyerbacher QUAD is the first quadrupel style beer to be commercially brewed and bottled in the United States.

In December 2002 QUAD won Mid-Atlantic Champion at the USBTC for the third year in a row.

Massively big and delicious, QUAD is an elegant and dark ale. Rich with complexity and flavor, try savoring it after a long day or during a fine dinner. You also might enjoy it as an aperitif or as an accompaniment to a dessert, but QUAD stands alone quite well. We recommend enjoying QUAD in a brandy snifter or wineglass so you can drink in the aroma of this fine elixir. QUAD, with an alcohol content of 11.8% (by volume) is the strongest beer we make, so please pay proper accord as you enjoy it.

As with any higher alcohol beers, QUAD will be at its best after a period of 6 or 12 months in the bottle, perhaps longer. We expect a shelf life of 3-5 years, but go ahead, we know you can't wait (we couldn't either). Enjoy one now, and another every month or two, and you'll be truly amazed as QUAD gains smoothness and complexity over time as it ages.
Enjoyed alone as a winter-warmer or as the perfect finish to any fine meal, our Raspberry Imperial Stout is a wonderfully full-flavored beer with just a "kiss" of raspberry flavor. 
When we brew this beer we add just a touch of real raspberries during the fermentation process. The result is a modest fruit flavor which enhances--- without dominating the rich, malty, stout taste.

Our Raspberry Imperial Stout (8.0% ABV) is great alone or as an after-dinner accompaniment. It's especially good with chocolate desserts. We brew it only during the winter months, so check out the Brewing Schedule on the "What's New"  page for the next time it will be coming to a beer store near you.
Our 12th anniversary brew is a Rye Barleywine.  Checking in at 10.2% abv, Twelve is being released in July and through the end of the year.   Made from 50% Rye Malt and 50% Barley Malt, this strong ale is extremely viscous. The rye adds a tantalizing note of flavor on the palate with a hint of tartness you've come to expect from Rye.  Slightly warm when its young, the beer will age very well, perhap 5 years or more.  We're guessing that peak taste will be in the 1 to 2 year old range, with 3 and 4 not far behind.  Be sure to lay some down in your collection.
The first thing you notice when pouring a glass of this seasonal beer is the color. Samuel AdamsÂ® Octoberfest has a rich, deep golden amber hue which itself is reflective of the season. Samuel AdamsÂ® Octoberfest is a malt lover's dream, masterfully blending together five roasts of barley to create a delicious harmony of sweet flavors including caramel and toffee. The beer is kept from being overly sweet by the elegant bitterness imparted by the German Noble hops. Samuel AdamsÂ® Octoberfest provides a wonderful transition from the lighter beers of summer to the winter's heartier brews.
This is a brew for adventurous beer drinkers. It is brewed with four malts: two row pale Harrington, Munich malt, chocolate malt, and a rare peat smoked malt commonly used by distillers of Scotch malt whiskey. This unique malt gives Samuel Adams® Scotch Ale its distinct, subtle smoky character and deep amber hue. Samuel Adams® Scotch Ale is brewed using traditional English hops, Goldings and Fuggles. This is a big brew dominated by malt flavors and aromas, rich and full bodied, slightly sweet. Its layered malt complexity lingers to a smooth and silky finish.
Proving the French may actually know something we don't... Garde Dog is a traditional French Biere de Garde or "beer for keeping". This classic farmhouse ale was brewed in March for drinking during the spring and summer months. With it's toasted aroma and spicy, malty sweetness Garde Dog will liberate you from the winter doldrum.
Brewed only in spring. Has a crisp taste, thanks to the kieffer lime leaves and lime added in. Has a light amber color and absolutely delicious!

Too extreme to be called beer? Brewed to a colossal 45-degree plato, boiled for a full 2 hours while being continuously hopped with high-alpha American hops, then dry-hopped daily in the fermenter for a month & aged for nother month on whole-leaf hops!!! Our 120 Minute I.P.A. is by far the biggest I.P.A. ever brewed! At 20% abv and 120 ibus you can see why we call this beer THE HOLY GRAIL for hopheads!

-changed to be 18% for aging purposes according to Dogfish Head brewery.
Esquire Magazine calls our 90 Minute .IPA., "perhaps the best I.P.A. in America." An Imperial I.P.A. brewed to be savored from a snifter. A big beer with a great malt backbone that stands up to the extreme hopping rate. This beer is an excellent candidate for use with Randall The Enamel Animal!

Rainer hop, all topped with a rich creamy crown. This very special offering will warm your soul and lift your spirits. Oh yeah, it also packs a royal kick at 8% alcohol.
DUCHESSE DE BOURGOGNE
from Brouwerij Verhaeghe is the traditional Flemish red ale. This refreshing ale is matured in oak casks; smooth with a rich texture and interplay of passion fruit, and chocolate, and a long, dry and acidic finish. After the first and secondary fermentation, the beer goes for maturation into the oak barrels for 18 months. The final product is a blend of younger 8 months old beer with 18 months old beer. The average age of the Duchesse de Bourgogne before being bottled is 12 months.
A tribute to the highly drinkable "every day" beers from French-speaking Belgium. Contains Belgian two-row pale malt and 7% wheat. This beer is lightly filtered with an earthy, spicy hop character from imported Styrian Goldings hops and a beautiful rich creamy head from the wheat.
At the request of you hopheads, we produced this I.P.A. with a deep golden color, plenty of hop bitterness balanced by malt sweetness. Because of the extensive dry hopping, there's a floral and citrus hop finish. It's then lightly filtered to maintain the appropriate body and flavor. The beer features a combination of American, English and German malts to balance the large amount of hops. The HopFish also uses three hop varieties at five different times and has been dry-hopped for two weeks with 22lbs of Nugget whole leaf hops.
This Belgian-style Abbey Dubbel is an exceptionally complex beer with many interwoven flavors. This classic-style Abbey beer features an immense head with a fruity nose and a generous body. Malty in the middle, the beer features a clean, almondy dry finish and a slight alcohol warmth. More like a wine than a beerâ€”it has a lot of the qualities of a fine Burgundy.

Beer writer Michael Jackson has praised the Flying Fish Dubbel as "a wonderful example of the style."
This ESB is a classic British extra special bitter made fresh with an American slant. A beautiful copper color with an amber head, this classic style features five different malts, including imported English malts, and three hop varieties.

An original American pale ale, our XPA highlights the subtle, sophisticated flavors and aromas of our Midwestern two-row malt and imported aromatic and Munich malts. Washington-grown Mt. Hood and Magnum hops create an extremely balanced beer with a beautiful straw color.
First released in 2002, and sold out in two weeks. A tribute to the classic Fest styles of Germany the O'Fish uses European malts hops and yeast. A beautiful reddish color, a savory malt profile and nice hop flavor, make this Fest beer quite drinkable. OktoberFish is great with food and especially great with Lederhosen.
This Belgian-style strong golden ale showcases a variety of the ingredients and brewing methods that help differentiate Flying Fish beers. The Grand Cru is fermented at a higher temperature than our other beers adding an undercurrent of fruitiness (although there is no fruit in the beer). Very lightly filtered, the Grand Cru exhibits complex mouthfeel, strong malt flavors, a spicy hop presence and a soothing alcohol warmth, followed by a clean, dry finish. It is excellent with food as well as served by itself.
Exceptionally smooth and thoroughly robust, Weyerbacher Scotch Ale has a deep delicious flavor that will warm you down to your wee little bones. Malty and roasty on the palate, and with distinctive caramel notes, this beer will satisfy the desires of any malty beer aficionado. 

Weyerbacher Scotch Ale is our interpretation of a beer style originating from Scotland, where the chilly damp weather calls for a hearty beer. Lacking the preservative powers of hops, scotch ales were brewed with high alcohol content to prevent spoilage. And at 8.7% ABV (alcohol by volume) Weyerbacher Scotch Ale definitely contains a warming belt.

We brew Weyerbacher Scotch Ale mostly in the cooler months of the year. Check out the Upcoming Events and Beers page for the next time it will be at a beer store near you.

Often called â€œmildâ€ if it is on draft, brown ale is a walnut-colored specialty of the North of England. A festive-occasion beer, brown ale is one of the oldest English brewing styles, mentioned in literature in the 16th century. Beers brewed at the old brewery have a round, nutty flavor because of the Yorkshire square system of fermentation.

The Norwegian JuleÃ¸l can be traced back more that 1000 years. The "Gulatinglov", one of the first Norwegian laws written in the 9th century, has a chapter on brewing beer for the midwinter celebration in January. The festivities were held to celebrate the Norse Gods; Odin, FrÃ¸y and Njord as well as the "return" of the sun.
Furthermore, the tradition was adopted by the Vikings that brought Christianity to the country between 1000 and 1100. They moved the tradition to December in connection with the birth of Jesus. 
In those days a farmer that did not set aside the best crop to produce the beer could lose his house to the king and the church. The law has been changed, but we promise you that we still use the very best of malt, yeast, hops, and pure Norwegian water to produce our Christmas beer.

Aass JuleÃ¸l has won most of the Norwegian JuleÃ¸l taste test conducted over time. For those of you that know what "lutefisk" is, Aass JuleÃ¸l is the perfect choice of beverage to this traditional Norwegian dish.
The Aass Bock is a dark "lager" also produced in accordance with the "Purity law". 

The malted barely is produced in the Scandinavian countries. It is a combination of bayer-, color- and caramel malt. 

We use the very best of hops from the Hallertau area in Germany, and the water is pure Norwegian mountain water. 

The Aass Bock is largered at cool temperatures, and it is allowed to mature for as long as 6 months before bottling. 

The beer is sold in a caracteristic nice-looking green bottle containing 11.2 fl. oz or 330 ml.
The Aass Genuine Pilsner is a premium "lager" produced in accordance with the "Purity law". The malted barely is a pilsnermalt produced in the Sandinavian countries. We use the very best of hops known under the name as Sazer and Hallertau, and the liquid is pure Norwegian mountain water.

Despite its rich heritage and enduring fame, Adnams is not a company willing to rest on its laurels. Its continued commitment to quality and innovative packaging designs has made it Britainâ€™s fastest growing brewery over the last two years. To top it off, Adnamsâ€™ head brewer was recently chosen as Britainâ€™s Brewer of the Year by a panel of his peers.

The Winter seasonal from Adnams, Fisherman is described as an old ale. If your local pub has the good sense to serve cask beer, look for Fisherman on draught from January through March.

Clean and refreshing yet dark and mysterious, Fisherman is a deep coppery red, conjuring roasted nuts and dark chocolate, with a lingering taste of liquorice and dried fruits.

After sampling a wide array of great beers, the duo hit upon an idea.  "I've got it!" exclaimed Matt, "we'll use vast amounts of whole hops, the finest malt, and put a little love in each batch."  "Eureka!" shouted Phin.  And thus became a beer so fresh and tasty they had to put their names on it.
IPA stands for India Pale Ale and ours is an American version of the classic style.  IPA's namesake lies in its colonial roots.  British soldiers on their way to India drank a lot of beer, but found it would go stale on the long voyages.  Meanwhile, brewers knew that by adding more hops the beer would stay fresh.  Voila!  A new style was born and it is one we are proud to brew.  Southern Tier IPA is triple-hopped on its journey to your glass for a fully aromatic experience.

This beer's roots are in Belgium, and the classic Wit biers produced by Belgium's brewers. The style gets its name from the white, milky appearance of this unfiltered wheat ale. The brewers of Samuel AdamsÂ® beer, taking inspiration from the Belgians, have created a classic of their own. On the malt side, we use malted two row Pale barley, malted wheat, and Munich malt to give this beer a crisp, malty, cereal finish and smooth mouth feel. The hops used are Noble Tettnang Tettnanger hops. At the end of the kettle boil, we add a proprietary spice blend to give Samuel AdamsÂ® White Ale a unique and complex flavor, without being overpowering or cloying. The spice blend includes orange and lemon peel, dried plum, grains of paradise, coriander, anise, hibiscus, rose hips, tamarind, and vanilla. It is this special blend of spices that gives Samuel AdamsÂ® White Ale its unique character, complexity and refreshing drinkability. The beer is coarse filtered, leaving a white haze from the malt proteins. Our proprietary top fermenting ale yeast ferments the beer, imparting its signature character - bright and slightly fruity.
Great tasting yet drinkable, with a clean smooth finish.

Sam Adams Light® finishes crisp and smooth without any lingering bitterness, leaving you yearning for more.
Spicy and Bold, a big Christmas cookie of a beer.
Samuel Adams® Old Fezziwig® Ale is the Christmas cookie of beer. Bursting with spices of the season and a remarkably full body, it helps those long winter nights pass much quicker. The full body hits the palate first with a depth of malt character ranging from sweeter toffee and caramel notes to the more dark, roasty chocolate notes. Then come the spices in full force. Cinnamon, ginger and orange peel dance on the tongue bringing with them the celebratory spirit that goes hand in hand with the season.
A Traditional, British style. Robust and full bodied.  Introduced as a member of the Winter Classics Mix Pack in 2004, Samuel Adams® Holiday Porter with its rich malt complexity has become a favorite among our winter seasonal brews.

Add generous portions of imported hops to the mix and one has a brew that is both robust and high in drinkability.
Ale brewed with Cherries, crisp and fruity with a hint of honey.  Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat® follows the centuries old American tradition of brewing beer with native ingredients, in this case Michigan cherries as well as a touch of honey.

The end result is a sweet, refreshing beer that is light on the palate but long on complexity.

This is a Bavarian ale which uses 51% wheat malt in the recipe. Very low bitterness. It is unfiltered so the characteristic cloudiness is achieved. The haze comes from suspended yeast. Hefe-Weizen literally means "yeast-wheat." The aroma is reminiscent of cloves and banana and is put out by the yeast. While some of this aroma carries over to the flavor, the dominant flavor is the malty wheat. 

Alcohol content approximately 5.0% by volume (ALWAYS ON TAP!!)
Our Hop Knot IPA is made only from American malt and lots of American hops, which produce a big, broad-shouldered, hoppy beer backed up by a character as warm as, well, Mom and apple pieâ€¦ 

Hop Knot IPA get its peculiar name from the weaving of four different hops added at four separate times during the brewing process. Including our cavernous hop-back, which gets so stuffed with whole leaf hops that we feel genuine guilt for its excess. Hop Knot is an ale that is to be enjoyed with friends, spicy food or any time you need a good hop fix without the harsh bitterness. We hope you enjoy this pioneering beer made in the bold spirit of Americans everywhere.

Our Oatmeal Stout is definitely a local favorite but it gets its origins from one of London's oldest breweries. The Oatmeal Stout differs from the popular Irish stout in its more subtle roastiness and subdued dryness. The addition of flaked oats rounds out these sometimes harsh characteristics producing a velvet smooth ale. This black stout has a flavor profile unique to all of North America. Subtlety is not a strong point as it is a stout after all, rich and eminently drinkable. 

Alcohol content of approximately 5.0% by volume (ALWAYS ON TAP!!)
The dominating character of this beer is of course peach flavor and aroma. It is a little more subtle than most fruit beers which makes it more approachable. Light in body and color. 

Alcohol content of approximately 4.0% by volume (ALWAYS ON TAP!!)
A Belgian Double Abbey.
Leroy's BIG Brother. Sweet floral hop aroma balances out the big malty roasted body with the slightest bitter spiced-chocolate finish.

This beer was brewed in honor of our brewer Melissa's wedding to fellow brewer Derek Osbourne of B.J.'s in Chandler. The Alt Ball and Chain is a German Altbier. These beers are generally full-bodied with sweet malt flavor. The crispness, dry finish, and moderate hop aroma make an alt a great beer for summertime enjoyment. Our Alt has been lagering in our cellar for two weeks and contains 5.2% abv.
This is the old tried and true Blind Date Ale of old. It is based on an English Olde Ale but has an addition of 300 pounds of Arizona grown Medjool dates. The dates contribute a complexity and sweetness that the malt alone cannot. This Blind Date has been aged for three months in Jim Beam oak bourbon barrels. The oak and bourbon lend flavors of vanilla, wood, and of course, bourbon. These flavors layered with the dates created a big, multi-leveled ale. The alcohol content is about 7.5% alc/vol. You'll have to get to Four Peaks quick since we only have a few kegs of this unique beer.
Belgian Wits originated in Belgium, in the area of Brabant just east of Brussels. This are was a part of the Netherlands in the early 1800's and was the wheat growing region. In this era, the Dutch basically controlled the spice trade, thus, coriander as well as Curacao orange peel made its way into the beer. Spices were used well before the widespread use of hops in beer. At one point there were more than thirty breweries producing a Wit, but overtime the style died off and in 1954 the last of the breweries ceased operations. One of the most famous brands of Belgian Wits is Hoegaarden (pronounced "Who Garden") produced by Pierre Celis back in 1966. This revived the style and by the 1980's it was popular again!

Belgian Wits are similar to a Hefeweizen with respect to the cloudiness of the beer and some phenolic (clove) and tart flavors. Wits should have white, rocky head when poured and should be almost white in appearance, hence the name. 

You will smell oranges and coriander which is different than a Hefeweizen that smells of banana and clove. Our version of a Belgian Wit is called "Hoof - Hearted Wit," and it is brewed to style with dried bitter and sweet orange peel and coriander seeds.
One of a kind ale. Brewed with 600 pounds of Arizona grown Medjool Dates added to the kettle. 1998 Gold Medal GABF. Alcohol content varies as every brew is slightly different. Usually very strong with sherry or port-like flavors. Brewed quarterly. Alcohol content approximately 7-9% by volume.
This almost black lager originates from Germany and is most closely associated with Porter. The difference being the long maturation period (or lagering time) required to produce a true Schwartzbier. The flavor is reminiscent of treacle, coffee and toasted malt. It is not and should not be perceived as burnt or ashy like some stouts. Black Betty has 5% alc/vol and a smooth character that marks most lager beers.

The name, of course, comes from the Huddy Ledbetter song from the 1940â€™s which was made popular by the band Ram Jam and later by the Black Crows and U2, among others.
Our rye beer is made with 20% flaked rye and rye malt. The addition of rye creates a dry, spicy flavor with a crisp, grainy aroma. We went with a lighter color and lower bitterness to compliment these flavors. It has an alcohol content of around 4.9%.

A golden wheat beer brewed with the finest North American malted barley and wheat.  It's then lightly hopped with the choicest European varieties.  The smooth, crisp golden wheat beer is then finished with a hint of rasberry.  Enjoy this beer any time of the year.
First sold in 75 cl (25.4 fl.oz.) bottles, it is noted for its coppery colour which makes it particularly attractive.

Topped with a creamy head, it gives off a light, fruity apricot aroma produced by the fermentation. The taste perceived in the mouth is a balance confirming the fruity nuances noticed in the fragrance. 

Its taste, which imparts a silky sensation to the tongue, is made refreshing by a light touch of bitterness. To the palate, the taster perceives a pleasant astringency which complements the flavour qualities of this beer very harmoniously.

Named Cinq Cents in 75 cl (25.4 fl.oz.) bottles, this beer with its typical golden colour, its slightly hazy appearance and its fine head is especially characterised by its aroma which results from an agreeable combination of fresh hops and yeast. 

The beer's flavour, as sensed in the mouth, comes from the smell of hops: above all it is the fruity notes of muscat and raisins that give this beer a particularly attractive aroma. 

The aroma complements the touch of bitterness. There is no acidity, but an after-bitterness which melts in the mouth.

Unfiltered wheat ale, fruity, bright, with a crisp flavor of wheat.  Samuel Adams® Hefeweizen beer is a traditional spin on a classic American craft brewing style.

Malty and slightly sweet, balanced by earthy notes from the hops.  The gentle rain and fertile soil of Ireland helped inspire this style of ale, known for being remarkably balanced. Pale and Caramel malts give the beer its rich, deep red color and distinctive caramel flavor. The sweetness of the malt is pleasantly balanced by a pronounced hop bitterness and an earthy note from the East Kent Goldings hops. Samuel Adams® Irish Red finishes smooth and leaves you wanting to take another sip.
Alt. The name of this beer style comes from the German word "alt" meaning "old". This refers to the aging that alts undergo since they ferment more slowly and at colder temperatures than most ales. Slow fermentation helps condition the flavors in Alaskan Amber, contributing to its overall balance and smoothness.

Richly malty and long on the palate, with just enough hop backing to make this beautiful amber colored "alt" style beer notably well balanced.

Alaskan Amber is made from glacier-fed water and a generous blend of the finest quality European and Pacific Northwest hop varieties and premium two-row pale and specialty malts.  Our water originates in the 1,500 square-mile Juneau Ice Field and the more than 90 inches of rainfall we receive each year.
Golden Ale. A blonde, lighter bodied beer with a floral aroma and a crisp, hoppy finish that's not bitter. The hop character of Alaskan Pale is due to dry hopping by hand during the fermentation process.

Smoked Beer. Known as "rauchbier" in Germany, smoke-flavored beers were virtually unknown in the U.S. until Alaskan Smoked Porter was developed in 1988.

The dark, robust body and pronounced smoky flavor of this limited edition beer make it an adventuresome taste experience. Alaskan Smoked porter is produced in limited "vintages" each year and unlike most beers, may be aged in the bottle much like fine wine.

Water, five types of malt, 2 varieties of hops and yeast with no adjuncts, no preservatives and no pasteurization. Our glacier-fed water originates in the 1,500 square-mile Juneau Ice Field. Prior to brewing, selected malts are smoked in small batches under carefully controlled conditions in a commercial food smoker using local alder wood.
English Olde Ale. Traditionally malty with the warming sensation of alcohol, Olde Ales are brewed in the fall as winter warmers.

Brewed in the style of an English Olde Ale, this ale balances the sweet heady aroma of spruce tips with the clean crisp finish of noble hops. Its malty richness is complemented by the warming sensation of alcohol.

Alaskan Winter is made from glacier-fed water, Sitka spruce tips and a generous blend of the finest quality European and Pacific Northwest hop varieties and specialty malts. Our water originates in the 1,500-square-mile Juneau Ice Field and from the more than 90 inches of rainfall we receive each year.
Based on the traditional style of KÃ¶lsch beer brewed in Cologne, Germany.

Alaskan Summer Ale balances a softly malted palate with the clean freshness of Hallertauer hops. In the tradition of the style, neither overpowers the other. Both hops and malt come together to refresh and renew the palate. The straw-gold color and easy drinkability are an enjoyable way to celebrate summer.

Alaskan Summer Ale is made from glacier-fed water and a generous blend of European and Pacific Northwest hop varieties and premium two-row and specialty malts. Our water originates in the 1,500 square-mile Juneau Ice Field and from the more than 90 inches of rainfall Juneau receives each year.
Alaskan Barley Wine is produced in small batches each year. Typically this higher alcohol beverage is brewed in the spring, cellared in the tunnels of the Alaska-Juneau Gold Mine for the summer and retrieved in time for its release at the Great Alaska Beer and Barley Wine Festival in January. The cool tunnels of the mine shaft provide natural refrigeration and a prime environment for the aging process. 

Like a fine wine, Alaskan Barley Wine can be aged for years. The bottling of the 2007 vintage of Alaskan Barley Wine will allow individuals to age it to their liking. â€œWe figured weâ€™d leave it up to individuals as to how long to age their Alaskan Barley Wine,â€ said Quality Assurance Analyst Ryan Harvey. â€œSome people like barley wines fresh, and others store it for years.â€


Rugged yet smooth, Kodiak Brown Ale balances caramel and roasted malts with enticing Northwest hops. Inspired by the adventurous spirit readily found in Alaska, Kodiak Brown Ale invites you to take the road less traveled. Like true Alaskans, we are not afraid of the dark.
Inspired by local artist & roaster Michael Allen's eccentricly-named blend of coffee beans, Midnight Sun's brewers designed a beer recipe and infusion process that perfectly captures the alluring aroma, satisfying flavor and curious legend of Allen's Arctic Rhino Coffee. 

Arctic Rhino Coffee Porter combines two quintessential Pacific Northwest favorites: coffee and ale. The result is wonderfully romantic and robust--a duel-fueled porter that melds charismatic dark malt with freshly roasted coffee beans. The (un)rest is up to you.

Free spirited Panty Peeler pours rambunctiously into your glass, releasing its engaging aroma. Curacao (bitter) orange peel and coriander create a beautiful yet bolder tripel by infusing color, citrus and spice. Belgian yeast adds playful character. Bottle conditioning assures a perfectly heady experience.

Brewed as a Belgian tripel but with American boldness, Panty Peeler is delicious yet spirited. Originally named Extreme Polar White Bier, it got nicknamed "Panty Peeler" along the way. Then we translated it to French for a while: E'pluche-culotte. Now we're back to calling it Panty Peeler and we've kicked up the coriander and orange peel to represent its original design.

Availability:
AK - 22-oz bottles (year-round) and draft (on occasion)

Dark and strong as the style implies, La Maitresse du Moine dances across the palate with complexity and mystery--just as the Northern Lights move across the night sky, delighting the senses and enlightening the mind.

In the tradition of monks who have devoutly brewed beers of character and strength for centuries, La Maitresse du Moine Dark Strong Ale reflects the passion and dedication required to create a beer this heavenly. This Mistress of the Monk is seductive, pensive and intriguing. We say it in French: La Maitresse du Moine.
Arctic Devil Barley Wine, aptly named after the ferocious wolverine of the north, is an English-style (meaning malt-inclined) barley wine. Though the recipe and process for Arctic Devil have evolved over the years, it is typically brewed in January then aged in oak barrels for several months before the entire batch is blended, bottled and released on the Friday after Thanksgiving. 

In its youth, Arctic Devil gnarls and snarls its way across the palate. Containing this beast of a beer for long periods in oak barrels--some having previously aged port, wine or whiskey--tames the unleashed malt and fierce hop flavors, melding and mellowing this powerful liquid into an incredible elixir worthy of a brewer's table. 

Each annual batch of Arctic Devil Barley Wine represents the brewers' resolve to create an intriguing and sought-after barley wine by precisely brewing to well-designed specifications, carefully selecting the type and combination of barrels to use for aging, and meticulously checking the beer as it ages. Distinct nuance and complexity are contributed by the wood's previous tenants, resulting in unique flavor profiles in each batch that continue to change over time. We invite you to savor Arctic Devil Barley Wine upon its release then cellar some for future enjoyment. 

Midnight Sun's elusive Arctic Devil Barley Wine is Alaska's most awarded barley wine.
When the loveable "hopheads" at Humpy's Great Alaskan Alehouse requested a winter version of alehouse favorite Sockeye Red IPA, our brewers instinctively spawned CoHoHo Imperial IPA.

CoHoHo begins with generous measures of pale two-row and specialty malts along with spirit-boosters like maple syrup, brown sugar and honey. Hefty doses of Cascade, Centennial and Simcoe hops beautifully balance that outrageous malt bill and heighten the festive character of this exuberant beer.
The days are long but the season is short. So what gives? Sleep! After doing more before midnight than most Outsiders do in a week, Alaskans deserve some down time. And these moments of relaxation demand more than that ordinary, non-distinct lawn mower beer. Celebrate a day well done with a beer done wellâ€”a seriously delicious IPA with some scorchinâ€™ hops. 

Our new seasonal double IPA is designed to keep you incredibly hopped up spring through summer.
This is our perennial summer seasonal beer, first brewed in Summer 1995 when we opened. 

Affectionately called "Spunky and Chunky", Old Whiskers Hefeweizen is a traditional Bavarian-style unfiltered wheat beer. Created with equal parts malted wheat and pale two-row malt, Old Whiskers is lightly hopped to style. A unique Bavarian strain of yeast imparts a clove- or banana-like aroma and flavor. (We swear we did not put cloves into the brew. It is the magical powers of The Yeast.) Old Whisker is delicious and refeshing--the perfect summer quencher, served with or without a slice of lemon.

Fallen Angel Golden Strong Ale, brewed on 6-6-6, is named in the tradition of Belgian golden strong ales--after the devil himself. 

Midnight Sun's Fallen Angel Golden Strong Ale is a traditional Belgian-style golden ale--beautiful gold in color with tiny, conniving bubbles forming a very thick, meticulous head. Effervescent and crisp, this seriously delicious elixir tempts the palate with apple (oh so Garden of Eden), pear and a little earthy mustiness. Fallen Angel captivates your senses with its lightness and brightness while its 8% ABV strength breathes fire into your soul, warming you from the inside out. 

Angel-like in appearance, the devil is in its strength. 

With its introduction in 2006 and its immediate cult following, Fallen Angel is now brewed and released about once a year.
Conspiracy Belgian-style Black Beer is the result of a collaboration between Midnight Sun brewers Gabe Fletcher and Ben Johnson and Pelican Pub (Pacific City, OR) brewer Ben Love. These brewers conspired during barley wine fest week to brew up a deviously delicious dark Belgian-style beer. 

Conspiracy is opaque black with a creamy beige head. Black malt shrouds it in mystery; the Belgian yeast imparts intriguing flavor; the alcohol adds danger. If you're up for this mission, watch your back.

Conspiracy will be released in Anchorage and Portland in April 2007.

As the story goes, I was redesigning our I.P.A. to be bigger and better but as it came together it started to take on a life of its own. After much deliberation and several pints of our new creation we decided to name him after the master of macabre, Edgar Allen Poe, as a tribute to his aptly named short story "HOP FROG." As Edgar fermented and spewed his almost abusive hop aroma throughout the pub, his legend and our thirst grew until finally one day, he was released into the world. We hope Edgar amuses you as much as he has us but stay on his good side because much like the story, this Hop Frog bites back!

Balance is a lovely thing in beers and Weldspatter IPA achieves balance without compromising hop presence. The hop flavor and aroma abound, but the bitterness is held in check to give our IPA a pleasant malt character as well.

Gratefully dedicated to the Rogue in each of us. In the early 1990s Dead Guy Ale was created as a private tap sticker to celebrate the Mayan Day of the Dead (November 1st, All Souls Day) for Casa U Betcha in Portland, Oregon. The Dead Guy design proved popular and was incorporated into a bottled product a few years later with Maierbock as the elixir. Strangely, the association with the Grateful Dead is pure coincidence.

Dead Guy is a German-style Maibock made with Rogues proprietary "PacMan" ale yeast. It is deep honey in color with a malty aroma, rich hearty flavor and a well balanced finish. Dead Guy is created from Northwest Harrington, Klages, Maier Munich and Carastan malts, along with Perle and Saaz Hops. Dead Guy Ale is available in 22-ounce bottles, 12-ounce 6-pack, and on draft.

A vienna style lager
An imperial bitter style using exotic traditional floor malts, citrus hoppy flavor, stupendous hop aroma. Hedonistic!"Mellow Beer Emboldened by Hops," Elaine Louies article in the New York TimesDining Out Section, (March 24, 1999) announced the release of latest Rogue elixir to be bottled. The article states that "The newest beer of Rogue Ales sounds more aggressive than it is. Brutal Bitter is actually full-bodied, deeply flavored, intensely hoppy brew. There is nothing brutal about the rich, deep, mellow taste. Its crackling but not sharp... This beer may raise eyebrows, but it wont pucker lips. The aftertaste is clean."

Rogue brewer John Maier describes his Brutal Bitter as a cross between a Very Extra Special Bitter and an Indian Pale Ale. Brutal Bitter was first brewed in 1996 for the 20th Anniversary of the Horse Brass Pub in Portland. Customer demand prompted Rogue to continue brewing Brutal for the Horse Brass as well as using it as Rogues premier pour at the 1998 Oregon Brewers Festival. At the 1999 SpringFest in Portland, Oregon, Brutal Bitter was unscientifically voted the Peoples Choice--it received twice as many votes as the runner-up.

Brutal combines Oregon hops with English Malts. The Oregon grown Crystal hop is a triploid variety developed from the German Hallertau aroma hop variety with contributions from Cascade, Brewers Gold, and Early Green. Crystal is the only hop used in brewing Brutal and it provides a massive amount of aroma without dry-hopping. The English malts used are floor malted Pipkin (a mellow cross of Maris Otter and Warboys, from an English company called Beeston), Cara Vienna and Cara Wheat. Brutal Bitter is packaged in Rogues classic 22 ounce silk-screened bottle, 12-ounce 6-pack (new for 2005), and is available on draft.

Dedicated to Spanish author Juan de la Cueva, who, in 1575, wrote of a an dish that combined seedless chipotles with beer: Chipotle Ale is based on Rogues American Amber Ale, but delicately spiced with smoked jalapeno (chipotle) chile peppers. Deep amber in color with a tight head, rich malty aroma, delicately smooth and crisp flavor, and subtle chipotle chili finish. Chipotle Ale is created from Northwest Harrington, Klages, and Maier Munich Malts; Willamette and Cascade hops; and Chipolte (smoked jalapeno) Peppers. Available in a 22-ounce (12/case), 12-ounce (24 loose/case) screened bottles, and on draft. Blend it with Rogue Chocolate Stout and create a Mole black and tan!
The recipe for Rogue Chocolate Stout was created several years ago for export to Japan. The exported twelve ounce Chocolate Bear Beer bottle label is in Kanji and features a teddy bear with a pink heart on his belly. Chocolate Stout was released for Valentines Day in 2001 in a twenty-two ounce bottle for the US market. The label features a Roguester (Sebbie Buhler) on the label. The bottled of Chocolate Stout is available on a very limited basis in the US, so get it while you can!

HazelNut Brown Nectar is a nutty twist to a traditional European Brown Ale. Dark brown in color with a hazelnut aroma, a rich nutty flavor and a smooth malty finish. Dedicated to the homebrewer in each of us--the homebrewer who inspired this creation is Chris Studach, a friend of Rogues resident wizard John Maier, who added a Northwest twist to the classic style by adding hazelnuts for the host homebrew at the 1993 American Homebrewers Association convention. Chris put the nut in nut brown!

Hazelnut Brown Nectar Ale is a blend of Great Western 2-row Pale, Munich, Hugh Baird Brown, Crystal 80 and Crystal 135, Carastan, and Beeston Pale Chocolate malts; hazelnut extract; Perle and Saaz hops. HazelNut Brown Nectar is available in a 22-ounce bottle, a special commemorative 3-litre bottle with ceramic swing-top, and on draft.
Honey Cream Ale is fermented warm like traditional cream ales but features an added twist--wildflower honey from Oregon. Honey imparts a dry, refreshing character to the beer because it ferments almost completely. The honey comes from a beekeeper in Blodgett, a tiny town 20 miles east of Newport.

Rogues Honey Cream Ale is a light, smooth, medium bodied ale, with a creamy head, hints of honey and a crisp light finish. Brewed with two-row Harrington, Klages and Munich malts and Crystal hops. Discontined for distribution in late 2005, available on tap only at Rogue Ales Public Houses.

In Britain, seasonal brews for winter are high in alcohol, robust, malty, and dark. The two main styles of these brews are Old Ales and Barleywines. As the name suggests, barleywines are similar to wines in alcohol and need aging but are derived from grain, not the grape. Rogues barleywine is described by beer expert Stuart Ramsey as: "A masterful, intense creation from brewer John Maier....it has achieved a depth and complexity usually associated with well-ages strong ales. I hope the brewery bottles some before it disappears." We call it the cognac of beers. An unfiltered and unfined Barleywine. Intense, robust, malty and dark. The cognac of beers. A hugh beer in a little bottle, this is a beer designed for sipping.

Soba (also known as buckwheat) is not a type of wheat but a member of the rhubard family (a fruit, not a grain!) Soba has been a longtime staple of Japanese cuisine because of its nutritional value. Buckwheat is high in potassium, phosphorous, vitamin B (50 percent more than wheat) and protein, and its virtually fat-free. The fruits of buckwheat plant are like small beechnuts, which are milled to separate the edible groats from the dark brown hulls. The groats are then roasted and used more or less like a grain (a good example is Kasha).

Morimoto Soba Ale is brewed with Roasted Buckwheat, Pale malt, Munich Malt, 13-17 Carastan Malt, and Crystal Hops. (Note, this beer contains Gluten.) The flavor is unique, toasty-nutty sensation with medium body and good hop bitterness. Morimoto Soba Ale is available in a 22 ounce silkscreened bottle and 13.2 gallon sankey kegs.

Stout was first introduced by Guinness in Ireland as "Extra Stout" (a stronger version of their Porter). Later, the stronger Imperial and Double Stouts emerged. Sweet, Milk, and Oatmeal Stouts are English adaptations with less alcohol and less bitter then the dry Irish Stouts. Victorian England recognized Oatmeal Stouts nutritional value and it is traditionally the drink of choice for nursing mothers and athletes. It is a beer equally at home with oysters as it is with a homemade pizza and freshly tossed green salad (or as a float over ice cream).

In 1998 the McAleese Brothers, owners of Kells Irish Pubs in Portland, OR, Seattle, WA, and San Francisco, CA, wanted to make an American beer that would float Guinness. 

Gerard and Patrick McAleese asked John Maier to create a beer with a green apple bite flavor profile. It took four batches to get it just right. John used acidulated malts imported from Europe to get the crisp, lemony/apple flavor the McAleese Brothers wanted. The bottle label reflects the McAleese family heritage, puctures the Kells Irish Pub logo, and a traditional Irish flutist. 

The first Kells Irish Pub opened in Seattle in October 1983 in Post Alley, above the historic Pike Place Market. The restaurant will remind you of the Old Country with its warm, cozy atmosphere and traditional surroundings. Theres also a patio outside thats a great place to feel the breeze from the Puget Sound and the buzz from the Market. Kells has Seattles largest selection of Single Malt Scotch. 

The Kells Irish Pub in Portland is a local landmark and has been named the #1 Irish Entertainment venue in America. Sit by the fire, belly up to the bar, check out the cigar room, and dont miss the St. Patricks Day Festival, the largest Irish Fest in Oregon. 

The Pub in San Francisco is next to the historic North Beach neighborhood and reflects the Old World charm and hospitality the McAleese family brought with them from Ireland.

Rogue Smoke(previously known as Welkommen on draft) is a German style Rauchbier (Smoke Beer), which was inspired by the Fall of the Berlin Wall. Most rauch brews are bottom fermented, however Rogue Smoke, is top fermented. It is orange-amber in hue with a delicate smoke aroma and flavor with an intense hop finish.

In All About Beer, August, 1995 issue, Christopher Brooks writes "Alder wood, indigenous to the Northwest, is the smoking agent, though a small amount of Bamberg malt is used in the mash, too. Beech is drier than alder, reports brewmaster John Maier, so we use a little of that for added complexity. Welkommen, a smoky, nutty ale, is also very dry, which given the 15 pounds of hops (perle and Saaz) added to each 15-barrel batch, is no surprise." The seven medals in nine years which Rogue Smoke won at theGreat American Beer Festival in Denver are also a tribute to this unusual brew.

Rogue Smoke is brewed with Great Western Harrington, Klages, Munich, Hugh Baird Crystal, Carastan (30-37 and 13-17), Chucks Alderwood Smoked Munich and Bamberg Beechwood Smoked malts; plus Perle and Saaz hops. Rogue Smoke is available in the classic 22-ounce seriograph bottle (replacing the older 7 ounce bottle) and on draft.

The hops are traditional "Goldings" variety grown around Ledbury, Herefordshire as they have been for centuries.
Our original Rogue Ale, Youngers Special Bitter (affectionately nicknamed YSB) is a classic English Special Bitter named after Bill Younger of the infamous Horse Brass Pub in Portland, Oregon. The Malt Advocate described Youngers Special Bitter as "rich and flavorful. A triad of caramel maltiness, fruitiness (apricots?), and hop bitterness in aroma and flavor. A fuller malt foundation than some other pale ales, with some background spiciness. Dry, hoppy finish." In the SouthWest Brewing News, Feb/March 1994 issue, George Fix wrote "A strong case could be made for Rogue Ale being included among the top 5 ales brewed in the US."

YSB is amber in color with a mild hoppy finish. Brewed with a blend of 2-row Harrington and Crystal malts, Willamette and East Kent Golding hops. YSB is available in the classic 22-ounce seriograph bottle (the 12-ounce 6-pack was phased out in early 2005), and on draft.
To quote Dr. John Harrison, a great influence on my brewing, "Mild ale is the only beer with an uninterrupted history from medieval times to the present day." The "mild" means low hop bitterness, "...which is the only essential feature of a mild ale." They can be light or dark in color, high or low in alcohol, dry or sweet. This is difficult for modern style wiennies to grasp. How can one style be so many things? How can I judge it good or bad?. The current Brewery Creek Dark Mild is medium brown, soft hops and about 3.5% abv. It could be a bit more estery. It is a lovely style.
"Guinness" is the prototype of all modern stouts. Many people, however, don't realize that there are different varieties of "Guinness" brewed around the world. "Draught Guinness* and "Foreign Extra Stout" are the two primary types brewed in Ireland. Foreign Extra is the one I have emulated. It is closer in style to the London Porters of old than to modern stout. Very dark and rich, not as dry as Draught, about 6% abv and around 60 IBUs (that's hop bitterness). I used "First Gold" hops because that's what I could get. Guinness use Nitrogen mixed with carbon dioxide to dispense their stout which adds to the creamy mouth-feel. BTW: The "Imported" Guinness you buy here in the US comes from Canada. It could just as well be brewed in the US but the common wisdom in the brewing world is that Americans prefer "imported" beers and will pay more for them.
A blonde ale that is very light in color and body with no bitterness. A thirst quenching, American light-bodied blonde ale.
The complex charactor of American hops and amber colored caramel malts make it crisp & refreshing.

Named in honor of our founder Jeff's bike trip through Belgium, Fat Tire Amber Ale marks a turning point in the young electrical engineer's home brewing. 

Belgian beers use a far broader pallet of ingredients (fruits, spices, esoteric yeast strains) than German or English styles. Jeff found the Belgian approach freeing. Upon his return, Jeff created Fat Tire and Abbey Belgian Ale, (assuming Abbey would be his big gun). He and his wife, Kim traveled around sampling their homebrews to the public. 

Fat Tire's appeal quickly became evident. People liked everything about it. Except the name. Fat Tire won fans is in its sense of balance: toasty, biscuit-like malt flavors coasting in equilibrium with hoppy freshness.
Dark brown with a nice tan head.
Sweet and aromatic.
Smooth and best served cold from a goblet or chalice.

I have had this on tab, in a 12oz bottle and 1 liter bottle.  It is very common on to be on tap in Belgium and Paris as well as in a bottle in the UK.

I have not seen it in the US nor can I find a distributor that could get it.

Unlike the image, does not have the creamy head like many Irish stouts (Beamish, Guinness, Murphys) and as a result lighter on the stomach and nice with a meal. Very distinctive taste which may put off those not accustomed to drinking stouts.I would recommend it for the more adventurous pallette.

Roast barley comes through in the taste.

In Northern English dialect sneck means door latch and a sneck lifter was a manâ€™s last sixpence which enabled him to lift the latch of a pub door and buy himself a pint, hoping to meet friends there who might treat him to one or two more.
Named Grande RÃ©serve in 75 cl (25.4 fl.oz.) bottles, it is principally distinguished by its character of a strong beer. 

This is a beer whose fragrance of fresh yeast with a light, flowery rosy touch is especially pleasant. 

Its flavour, noticed when tasting it, only accentuates the pleasant sensations perceived in the aroma , while revealing a light but pleasant touch of roasted malt.

This top fermented Trappist beer , refermented in the bottle, is not pasteurised.

Our ESB combines the best of English tradition with West Coast style. A blend of malts featuring British-grown Maris Otter is balanced with the earthy spiciness of hand-selected English and US hops. The ale is left unfiltered, which enhances mouthfeel and hop aroma creating a slightly reddish-copper hue
From the Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. website:
Our Summerfest® is a refreshing, pilsner-style lager. Its incredible smoothness comes from an extra-long lagering period. Lighter in body than our ales but just as complex in character, Summerfest® quenches your thirst with big aroma and a tangy hop bite.

From the Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. website:
Each fall we celebrate our anniversary as one of Americaâ€™s craft brewing pioneers with a special beer.  This year, in celebration of our 27th year, we have made this beer available to the public for the first time, and aptly named it Anniversary Ale.    

Anniversary Ale is an American-style IPA featuring Cascade hops, the signature hop used in our Pale Ale. The beer has a pronounced pine and citrus hop aroma balanced by the sweetness of two-row pale and caramel malts. The result is an unusually well-balanced IPA that proves an IPA can be both assertive and elegant. Anniversary Ale is a medium-bodied, well-hopped ale that finishes with a slight malt sweetness.

"Broken Halo IPA is a beer produced in the spirit of traditional IPA products shipped from the UK to India in the late 1800s. The almost excessive amounts of Cascade and Columbus hops used in Broken Halo give it notable citrus and grapefruit aromas and flavors.

-Widmer Brothers Brewing Company

In 1963, the Benedictine abbey of Maredsous entrusted the production and sales of the famed Maredsous beers to Duvel Moortgat. The monks continue to exercise strict control over its recipes and quality standards right up to today.

 

Regardless of what colour or taste you choose, the Maredsous range has everything to intrigue you. These aromatic, delicate, fruity and velvety beers supplement each other in a perfect harmony as far as both colour and taste experience are concerned.

The blonde Maredsous with 6% alcohol content, the brown one with 8% alcohol content and the triple one with 10% alcohol content ripen first for two full months before they depart to their final destination. The specific bottle fermentation, refined by the brewery for its main brand Duvel, also give the Maredsous abbey beers an extra dimension. 	 

About Maredsous

The triple Maredsous with 10% alcohol content is one of the favourite beers of Michael Jackson, the outstanding beer â€™popeâ€™:
"These beers have long been my favourites. Above all the 10Â° is an especially tasty beer."

Negra Modelo has long been the dark beer alternative for Mexican beer drinkers. It has been identified as one of the few surviving examples of Vienna style lager - a style that was largely replaced in European breweries with Oktoberfest, a slightly lighter lager, in the early twentieth century. 
Negra Modelo pours with an off-white, medium head. The body is clear with a rich amber/copper color. The aroma is sweet with hints of apple. The impression at the first sip is sweet. This gives way only a bit to some hops bitterness which gives some balance but leaves the beer firmly in the sweet category. It has no real lager snap at the end, just lingering hops. This actually makes the second sip more balanced than the first.

There is some complexity and depth here but the flavors are very delicate. They are obliterated by the aggressive flavors of the Mexican food that Modelo is often served with making it a sweet balance to the savory and sometimes hot cuisine.
Birra Moretti La Rossa is a double boch beer produced using high quality 100% malted barley, giving it a rich sweet taste and an intense fragrance of roasted malt. The amber color that characterizes the beer, comes from the kind of malt used in the recipe (malt is dried, roasted barley). Another key ingredient is hops, the variety used is particularly aromatic, giving a characteristic bitter aftertaste and a delicate fragrance to the beer. The Master Brewers advise a service temperature between 10Â° and 12Â° C.

The National Beer of Texas
"Lone Star beer uses the finest hops from the Pacific Northwest with hearty grains from the Central and Northern Plains. The GABF recognized Lone Star as a high quality American Cream Lager by awarding it with a silver medal.

Hooker Irish Red is drinks well year-round, not just on St. Paddy's day.
Originally known as "B to the E"
Introduced in 1989 Bud Dry is the first dry-brewed beer produced by an American brewer. It is brewed with select hops, grains and barley malt, which results in a lighter body and less-sweet taste. As with all Anheuser-Busch beers, it is cold-filtered for a smooth draft taste, but then goes through a second cold-filtered finishing process to provide its unique taste.

Exactly what it says, Bud Light and Lime. Brewed in Georgia.



Actually an Ice Lager. Introduced in 1984.

Gulden Draak is a beer in a class of its own. It is a beer that is rich and glowing, so full of its very own characteristic flavour, that it reminds some who try it of chocolate and others of coffee. In 1998 Gulden Draak was crowned â€œbest beer in the worldâ€ by the American Tasting Institute! This beer has won many other awards too. Gulden Draak is named for the golden statue at the top of the clock tower of the Belgian city of Gent. The statue was originally given to the city of Constantinople by the Norse King Sigrid Magnusson in 1111, during the crusades; hence the form of a Viking ship that the beast was given. During a later crusade, Boudewijn IX (Count of Flanders and Emperor of Constantinople) took it back to Flanders with him because it was so beautiful. In 1382, the cities of Brugge and Gent did battle for the statue. Gent won.


The best beer ever!
Stella is the most famous brand of beer in Egypt. It has been manufactured in Egypt since the 19th century and so many Egyptian, and actually many experienced travelers, prefer it to any other kind of beer. One will not find a single bar in Egypt that doesnâ€™t sell Stella or even have the Stella logo on the bar or shop. Stella can even be found in many bars in Europe
Slightly dangerous beer - tastes like an 8% blonde, delivers like nothing else. A little tart around the edges, due to the higher alcohol content, but otherwise a pleasant strong pils taste : not too much hop on the palate.

Very good dark beer. Not as heavy as stout.

"Piraat is a 'living' beer, which means that after the primary fermentation in the keg, the beer also continues to evolve during the secondary fermentation in the bottle or in the keg after packaging. This is a world-class amber colored beer. American beer connoisseurs give it 98 out of 100. No other beer scores better. The flavor is so complex and so rich that every swallow conjures up new associations. Note the spicy light sweetness, which is richly balanced with the robust bitterness of the hops. It is an adventure of a beer, a treat."

TOASTED LAGER

Blue Point Brewing's award-winning Toasted Lager is our flagship product. Copper in color this brew is made from six different malts including: English Pale, Crystal, Munich, Carapils, Wheat and Belgian Caravienna. Toasted Lager displays a balanced flavor of malt and hop which makes for easy drinking. Special lager yeast is used to produce that long lasting, smooth finish. The "toasted" part of the name refers to our direct-fire brew kettleâ€™s hot flames that impart a toasted flavor to our most popular microbrew.
From the Goose Island website:

"Our IPA recalls a time when ales shipped from England to India were highly hopped to preserve their distinct taste during the long journey. The result, quite simply a hop lover's dream. And this classic ale adds a fruity aroma, set off by a dry malt middle, to ensure that the long hop finish is one you'll remember."
German Pilsner beer, with quite a bit of hops taste.
A classically brewed export beer with a slight aroma of hops.

If being in one of the coldest places in the US isn't extreme enough, the contents of this beer may very well redefine your commitment to the pursuit of hops. Rockslide IPA is brewed in the 'West Coast' style with aggressive amounts of American hops such as Amarillo, Centennial and Summit hops. You are greeted with a full frontal assault of citrus/grapefruit/pine hop character, followed up with malt to balance the mouthfeel. This beer is all about hops.

Delicious
Below-average but drinkable IPA, cheaply priced (~$1/bottle), and available at Trader Joe's.



From their site:

"Harpoon IPA is an interpretation of the classic English style using hops and malt grown in the United States."

...

"The high hopping of Harpoon IPA is not only noticeable in the nose but especially in the finish. The lingering bitter finish of this beer is not harsh or astringent, but crisp and pronounced. This is created, in part, by dry hopping â€“ a technique that involves adding fresh hops to the conditioning beer to provide a fresh hop aroma.

This beer is floral, medium body with an aggressive, clean hop finish."

----

This has been my year-round favorite since moving to Boston in 2004.  It is the nectar of the gods.  Seriously, it's a nicely balanced, hoppy IPA that isn't overpowering.  Also, it can be consumed in huge quantities with no hangover.
From Harpoon's site:

"UFO Hefeweizen is an American unfiltered wheat beer.  Perhaps UFOâ€™s initial sensory perception is also its most prominent: a cloudy golden color and a dense, frothy head.  The yeast, which has not been filtered out, accounts for the cloudiness of UFO.  Wheat malt tends to create a larger head than barley malt, the cereal grain most often used in brewing.  When served in a traditional wheat beer glass with a lemon, UFO presents an appealing and distinctive visual image.

The aroma has a faint but clear citrus-like character.  This is produced by the special yeast and accounts for the Bavarian tradition of serving hefeweizens with a lemon.  The lemon accentuates the yeastâ€™s fruity, tart fragrance.  UFO has a soft mouthfeel and a refreshing, light body.  The wheat malts and subtle hopping give the beer a mild, delicate flavor.  UFO has a clean finish.  Unlike some imported hefeweizens, UFO does not have the spicy, tropical flavors typical of European-brewed style.

The overall character is a cloudy appearance with a citrus-like aroma, light body, and clean finish.  Serve with a lemon."
From Harpoon's site:

"When first seeing Harpoon Ale in a glass, you will notice its golden caramel color. You will also see that it is not excessively carbonated. High carbonation would mask this beerâ€™s subtle flavor. The first aroma will be fruity. This is produced by the yeast and is a signature characteristic of Harpoonâ€™s proprietary yeast strain. The second perceptible aroma is from the malt, with a delicate caramel note. Upon tasting Harpoon Ale, you will find that the malty, fruity character is nicely balanced by the mild hop bitterness. It has a smooth, medium body. The finish of this beer is crisp but not dry.


The overall character of this beer is fruity, balanced, and mild."
Hoegaarden is the authentic Belgian wheat or white beer. It has a unique and extremely complex brewing process whereby the brand is first top fermented and then is refermented within the bottle - ending up in a unique cloudy-white appearance. The brand's unique appearance is mirrored by its one-of-a-kind taste - sweet and sour beer with a little bitterness, slightly spicy, with a strong touch of coriander and a hint of orange, perfect for warm summer days, instead of other refreshing beverages. Refreshing, a little quirky, and decidedly different - naturally.
The inspiration for making a Black IPA (or should we say "India Black Ale/ IBA"?) has been over a year in the making. As soon as we wrapped up the brewing of the Stone 10th Anniversary IPA, we started brainstorming ideas for the Stone 11th Anniversary Ale, and the Black IPA concept was born. This was a challenging brew to formulate and achieve what we considered the ideal flavor balance of intense up-front hops with balanced roasted malt flavors, a deep, rich flavor, and a hearty bitterness.
Three Floyds official summer beer highly dry hopped American wheat beer. Quite hoppy. Gumballhead is brewed from red wheat and amarillo hops. It has a medium haze, due to bottle conditioning; once the beer is bottled, extra yeast is added for a secondary fermentation. The hops give off a pronounced citrus note on the nose. Notes of bread - from the yeast - and a good malt undertone. Medium carbonation.
Honkerâ€™s Ale combines a spicy hop aroma with a rich malt middle to create a perfectly balanced ale that is immensely drinkable. A smooth, drinkable English Bitter for those looking for more from their beer.

A rich golden liquid with a unique flavor and aroma that comes from a touch of raw Hawaiian cane sugar. Primo is a premium lager that represents the best of both worlds; the rich taste of a craft-brewed beer with the drinkability of a lighter lager. -http://www.thatsprimo.com/Recipe.aspx
Anchor Summer is the first American wheat beer in modern times. Our first brew of this light and refreshing beer was in the summer of 1984.

Anchor Summer is an all-malt beer, and over 50% of its malt comes from malted wheat. It is fermented with a Triticum aestivum, AKA wheat traditional top-fermenting "ale" yeast because we prefer the clean flavors developed by this yeast. We believe that this style best celebrates the refreshingly light flavor of malted wheat. You may notice that the head on this beer is unusually abundant, with a consistency similar to whipped egg whites. This is due to protein contributed by the wheat.

The brewers at Anchor are proud to have revived not only rich hearty dark beers, but also this light crisp style of a modern American wheat beer.

Summer getaway Wheat malt contributes to an unusual lightness and dryness to the palate, and thisâ€”combined with the distinctive flavor of the wheatâ€”makes for a perfect thirst-quenching beverage. It is the ideal drink for beer lovers who appreciate tradition and character in their beer, but also seek a lighter, refreshing style, perfect for warm weather.

A rich, creamy stout with roasted chocolate flavors. A perfect dessert beer.
Diacetyl dominated cask bitter.

While ales are fermented for relatively short periods of time at room temperature, lagers employ a special variety of yeast and much cooler fermentation temperatures to achieve their truly clean, dry flavour profile. Our Lion's Gate Lager has a light body, a very crisp palate and a soft, hop finish, which is imparted by the exquisitely gentle Czech Saaz hop variety. The Lions would approve.
Every year in Vancouver there are a few days when the air is cool & crisp, the sun shines brightly, and the leaves show their vibrant colours -- then it starts to rain incessantly. Anyway, our Cascadia Cream Ale is dedicated to the spirit of mountains, oceans, golden days and gentle mist. Caramel and honey malts lend this ale a mellow, grainy maltiness which is balanced by the subtle presence of English finishing hops. Cheers, our Cascadia Cream Ale will be sure to brighten up even the wettest West Coast day.
The term "Pale Ale" dates back to the 1800s when all beer was dark brown in colour. New malting techniques led to the development of pale malt, a barley malt kilned at low temperatures which contributed very little colour to the finished beer. Hence the birth of Pale Ale, an amber- to copper-coloured ale you could actually see through. Plenty of British Crystal malt in the grist lends this ale its rich colour, its caramel maltiness, and adds the occasional whiff of toffee to the nose. An addition of American and German hops to the kettle at the end of the boil is used to suffuse our Pale Ale with a gently spicy hop finish.
Our regulars have many reasons for frequenting our premises. Some come for the comfy chairs, a game of pool, or to exude some seriously suaveness at the oyster bar on a Friday evening. For the truly devoted, however, who come in search of truth, it's the Nut Brown they're after. Often they arrive with a glazed look in their eyes, having endured days of office drudgery or the unknowable hardships of securing a parking spot. Set your cares aside, for all can find solace in this ale's yin-yang of nutty maltiness and delicate, dryish hoppiness. For our Nut Brown, an ale deep auburn in colour, we use a blend of Munich, caramel and chocolate malts to create a rich malty palate with a lingering dry chocolatiness.
During the heyday of the British Empire, India Pale Ale was born as a strong pale ale brewed especially to endure the rigors of the long journey to the colonies. In order to guard against spoilage, I.P.A. was brewed with a high alcohol content and with liberal amounts of hops, which act as a natural preservative. This ale's golden amber colour only hints at its full-bodied flavour. Its sumptuous maltiness is tempered by a goodly amount of bitterness and a mouth-filling hop flavour. In order to finish our I.P.A. with a truly fresh hop bouquet, we dry hop this ale in the serving tank with both East Kent Goldings and Mount Hood hops.
There are some things in life that require a certain sense of bravado: these might include ordering a quadruple espresso, deciding to sleep without a nightlight, or choosing to live in a region of the continent that is gradually sinking into the Pacific Ocean. If you're no longer scared of the dark, then there's no reason to be afraid of our stout. A generous portion of rolled oats and lots of black roasted barley give this beer a warm, roasted nose, and a distinct dryness that succumbs to waves of lingering satisfaction.
Our Pilsner is a true beer drinker's beer inspired by the first golden lagers brewed in the Czech town of Pilsn. This full-bodied lager is hopped with copious amounts of Sterling hops, lending it a refreshing, citrusy finish.
Our Hefeweizen is a faithful version of the traditional Bavarian wheat beer. Hefe is the German word for 'yeast' and weizen means 'wheat'. This beer is made with 40% wheat malt and is brewed with a special yeast that tends to stay in suspension, giving the beer its cloudy appearance. Bavarians are so convinced of the healthful qualities of this yeasty brew that doctors there are known to prescribe two Hefeweizens a day to feeble patients. The yeast used for this brew also imparts its unique spicy, clovey flavour. Some people even detect a light banana flavour. All of these wacky flavours are the natural 'signature' left by this specific yeast strain during its fermentation of the beer and no additional spices are added.
As you look out over Vancouver's Coal Harbour, relax with this creamy delight. Don't let the colour fool you - this porter is rich but not overpowering with a head that lingers all the way down the glass. Just about anything goes with our Coal Porter, and you don't have to belong to "High Society" to enjoy a glass with oysters.
A spiced ale that tastes just like pumpkin pie in a glass.

The Pumpkin Ale is a malty, copper coloured brew that's spiced with cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and ginger. We add 100 lbs of pumpkin directly to the mash and the resulting beer tastes just like pumpkin pie in a glass.
An intriguing fruit beer brewed with fresh sour cherries.

Our Sour Cherry Ale is inspired by the centuries old Belgian tradition of brewing beer with cherries. This high gravity brew undergoes a slow second fermentation with tons of fresh, whole Montmorency cherries from a local orchard in the Fraser Valley. The result is a most intriguing beer with an elegant cherry perfume, a tart, fruity flavour, and a subtle almondy finish.
"Tall and tan and young and lovely"

Originating in Belgium, this is a truly bilingual brew. Known as Biere Blanche in French, Witbier in Flemish and White beer in English. Unmalted wheat and oats are used in the grist to lend this brew its smooth, light body. Coriander seed and Curacao orange peel are added to the kettle to infuse this beer with a subtle, perfumey spiciness. The result is a light wheat beer with a fruity, tart finish - the essence of summer.
A ruby-red raspberry beer with a luscious, pink head

Our Frambozen is inspired by the centuries old Belgian tradition of brewing beer with raspberries. This high gravity brew undergoes a slow second fermentation with tons of fresh, whole Fraser Valley raspberries. The result is a ruby-red fruit beer with a intense raspberry flavour, a nice tart finish and a luscious pink head.
A strong, fruity, belgian-style trippel 8.5% alc./vol.

Our aptly named Christmas Ale is based on the strong beers traditionally brewed by Belgium's trappist monasteries. Trippel is typically at least 8% alc./vol. and has a light golden colour. Because of its high strength this beer has an intensely fruity palate. Up front it has a honeyish sweetness but the finish is dry and champagne-like. Most weary Christmas shoppers would be well advised to benefit from the warmth and 'ho-ho-ho factor' that only a beer of the Biltzen's calibre can provide.
â€œA complex, flavourful and fascinating ale lies just on the edge of being totally out of control.â€ â€”Stephan Beaumont, Celebrator Beer News

India Pale Ale dates back to the 1700â€™s when Britain needed a hearty beer to ship to her troops in India. Because the ships had to cross the equator twice to get there, spoilage was a major problem until some clever brewer realized that both alcohol and hops are natural preservatives. James brews Hurricane I.P.A. in this tradition, and packs it with enough hops and alcohol to survive crossing the orbit of Mercury twice. The grist is 100% Gambrinus premium 2-row barley malt, copiously hopped with fresh Centennial and Willamette. The result is a rich, golden, intense beer with bitterness in perfect balance with residual sweetness.
Derives its name from the historical fact that at one time in Europe beer was about the only safe liquid to drink. Black Plague is Irish style dry stout brewed only in fall and winter and only in small batches to ensure the freshness so paramount to such an intensely roasted beer.
While hugely popular in Scotland, this style of beer escapes most North Americans. Designed and brewed by the Scottish punk rocker David â€œMaltyâ€ Macanulty, this creamy, nutty, malty, dark ale is true to its origins. David drives James crazy over this beer, insisting on rigid fermentation temperatures, traditional mild hops for bittering, and even some weird caramelizing ritual as the kettle is being filled. The beer continues to undergo subtle evolutionary changes because the stubborn Scottish bastard will never be satisfied.
A true North German Style Pilsner. Light in body and packed full of Czech Saaz hops. The distinctive Pilsner aroma and dry, refreshing taste make a great accompaniment to a hot Vanouver day.
These authentic Belgian-style ales are intensely sour, dry and complex. All three of the lambics - Raspberry, Blackberry and Black Cherry - are aged in oak casks for more than one year. 15 kg, give or take, of whole unpasteurized fruit is added to each 200 litre oak barrel of fermented beer. The naturally occurring wild yeasts cause a second, slow fermentation, breaking down the fruit sugars to total dryness.

Strong, full-bodied ale with an intense hop character and deep golden color
(White of Chambly) was the first bottle
refermented ale produced by Unibroue. It is
brewed from a blend of pale barley malt,
wheat malt and unmalted wheat, to which
we blend selected spices and hops.
 
Blanche de Chambly is only partially filtered,
retaining its natural cloud of yeast that is
characteristic of the original white ales
brewed during the Middle Ages.

We recommend this remarkably refreshing
White ale brewed with apple must

Redolent of ripe Granny Smith apples, this
unique white ale pleases the palate with a
delicate balance of fruit and spice notes and
just a hint of sweetness.
 
Ã‰phÃ©mÃ¨re apple satisfies with each sip and
refreshes in all seasons, especially when
paired with an artisan cheddar cheese, pork
tenderloin served with apple chutney or Vidalia
onion soup.

We developed the Ã‰phÃ©mÃ¨re (Ephemeral)
series to feature a seasonal fruit in a
refreshing, lightly spiced white ale.
 
The label depicts a fairy, an ephemeral spirit
associated with fruits picked at the peak of
ripeness during each harvest season. 
Ã‰phÃ©mÃ¨re apple flavor is brewed with apple
must, which consists of the freshly-pressed
juice from apples.

Enjoy this beer 'alfresco' while dining in the
afternoon sun, relaxing at a family gathering or
at a picnic in the back yard.

The copper-colored body and generous foam
head of this amber ale tantalize the eyes but
it's the complex flavor of Seigneuriale that
delivers a pleasant surprise. It is slightly
sweet, malty and spicy, but a distinctive hop
character and notes of apricot brandy give
Seigneuriale a truly unique character. 

We recommending pairing it with carved ham,
apricot-glazed duck or squab, Thai shrimp
curry or a holiday fruit cake.
The opaque blackness and beige-colored
foam mousse of Chambly Noire belie its light,
refreshing body and clean, long finish,
featuring hints of roasted coffee beans, toast
and toffee. 

We recommend pairing it with grilled salmon,
steak or tuna au poivre, smoked meats,
coffee-crusted rack of lamb, or chocolate
espresso flan.
Many Mexican beer styles today are descendants of old Austrian styles, from when Austria ruled Mexico in the late 19th century. Our Dos Perros is made with German Munich malt, English Pale malt, and Chocolate malt, and hopped with Perle and Saaz hops. To lighten the body, as many Mexican brewers do, we add a small portion of flaked maize. The result is a wonderfully bready malt aroma, balanced with some maize sweetness and a noble hop finish.

Food Pairings: The toasty malt flavors go great with barbeque, grilled salmon, carmelized onions, and most hot and spicy foods. Try it with Mexican or Thai dishes.

A rich, chocolaty English Porter with a clean finish. We use the finest floor-malted Maris Otter malts from England, the same malts used for the best single-malt scotch. A portion of malted rye gives a spicy, slightly dry finish.

The wonderful hop aroma is balanced nicely with a toasty malt body, ending with a cleansing hop finish. Made with English Pale, Munich, Vienna, and Crystal malts, and generously hopped with Amarillo, Perle, and Cascade hops. Fermented with our English ale yeast.

Food Pairings: The bracing bitterness of this beer can hold its own with spicy foods, while helping to cleanse the palate after rich, creamy dishes. The citrus hop flavors go exceptionally well with any dishes using cilantro, such as Mexican salsas.

The tan lace clings to the glass as you raise the pint to your lips. Close your eyes and smile as the rich espresso notes fade to a dry, roasted finish. Exceptionally smooth and satisfying. Made with English Pale malt, roasted barley, black patent malt, and flaked barley. Hopped with East Kent Goldings and Target hops, and fermented with our English ale yeast.

Food Pairings: The combination of Onward Stout and oysters is a match made in heaven. It also goes well with other shellfish, grilled steaks, and believe it or not, rich chocolate desserts. Carbonade Flamande, seared beef cubes simmered in Stout for several hours, is a classic Belgian dish.

An authentic example of a Bavarian Hefeweizen. â€œHefeâ€ means cloudy or yeasty and â€œweizenâ€ means wheat. This beer is made with mostly wheat and uses a true Hefeweizen yeast that gives it a fruity, banana aroma with just a hint of cloves. The tart finish makes this the perfect summer beer.

Paulaner Salvator, with its strong, typically malty flavour, is what you could call the "original" Paulaner. The bottom-fermented "Doppelbock" beer combines the finest hops and dark barley malt. The Paulaner monks used to drink Salvator as a food substitute during Lent. The most famous master brewer was Frater Barnabas, who took over the Paulaner monastery brewery in 1773. His original recipe remains practically unchanged to this day. In order to preserve the original, Paulaner registered the name "Salvator" with the patent office in 1896.

Palo Santo Marron (Holy Tree Brown)

An unfiltered, unfettered, unprecedented brown ale aged in handmade wooden brewing vessels. The caramel and vanilla complexity unique to this beer comes from the exotic Paraguayan Palo Santo wood from which these tanks were crafted. Palo Santo means "holy tree" and it's wood has been used in South American wine-making communities. 

This beer is a 12% abv, highly roasty, and malty brown ale aged on the Palo Santo wood.  It was a huge hit at our Rehoboth Beach brewpub when first released in November of 2006, so it's coming back... into full production!

 At 10,000 gallons each, these are the largest wooden brewing vessels built in America since before Prohibition.

Click below to watch "Take Time," the short film we released with the first full-production batch of Palo Santo Marron in February 2008.

From their website:
"Have you read the description for the regular Crooked Tree yet? Well this beer is almost the same just double. We actually took the Crooked Tree recipe and doubled all of the ingredients except the water, just the way a DOUBLE should be made. Big hops balanced with tons of malt give this beer a huge body. Although this beer is as cool as "the Fonz"  when first purchased, it gets really mellow and smooth with some age. After a year or two stored in a cool dark place you'll notice the heavy caramel and malt flavors are trying to sneak past the hops, theyâ€™re just not fast enough. This beer is hugely delicious so it will need your undivided attention (the chores can wait....trust us)."
The first in our Brew Crew Big Beer Series, Hopmouth Double IPA is a hop loverâ€™s delight!

This is a BIG beer.  True to our original vision, we have achieved a level of balance and drinkability rarely found in this style.  Delicious on its own, Hopmouth is also a brilliant pair with many boldly-flavored foods, including many cheeses and desserts.

HOP HENGE IMPERIAL IPA â€“ The Ultimate in Hop Innovation 

Hop Henge Imperial IPA returns to the Bond Street Series line-up this April in extreme fashion. Staying true to the experimental nature of the series and the â€œnever settleâ€ philosophy of Deschutes, our brewers went back to the drawing board to create an amplified version of last yearâ€™s monument to hops.

Head Brewer Brett Porter says, â€œThis is a truly exciting and groundbreaking beer. We reformulated everything about the hop recipe to give Hop Henge an extraordinary aroma and flavor similar to a fresh hop beer.â€ In addition to the Cascade and Centennial hops, Deschutes Brewery is experimenting with a hop variety so new that it has yet to be named.

The team here at Bend Public House recommends Hop Henge as the perfect accompaniment for a variety of spicy foods, so be sure to have a bottle handy next time you make a batch of hot wings and go for the five alarm award. The high-octane hoppiness is a wildly refreshing antidote to a wide array of hot foods.

Limited Availability April through June.

Donâ€™t miss this amazing hop experiment that is sure to leave your taste buds begging for more.

Available April through June.

Hop Henge I.P.A. was first brewed in 2006 as an agressive West Coast style I.P.A. In 2007, Hop Henge is going Imperial!  Several pounds of  Centennial, Cascade and Northern Brewer hops are in each barrel with a heavy dry-hop presence to top it off.  A blend of crystal, pale and caraston malts creates an overall biscuity characteristic that is dense and muscular, building the alcohol base to support the monstrous hop profile.

Like the rest of the Bond Street Series, Hop Henge highlights the creativity and curiosity of our brewers.  Bolder than its English ancestors, with huge hops and a bitter finish, this IPA is no wallflower.

Alcohol By Volume: 8.1%
	

IBU 95

When one of our brewers suggested we name our new IPA Hop Henge, he also came up with the idea of actually recreating Stonehenge, only with hop bales.  We were up for the challenge and even though the weather did not want to cooperate, we pulled it off and threw a party afterwards.

5 out 5 stars 
Hop Henge started its life as an India Pale Ale, but this year it was bumped up to â€œImperial IPAâ€ status, with a hefty dose of additional hops.
â€œThis one is lovely,â€ said taster Tom Conti. â€œThey got it just right.â€
It pours out a deep amber, with an appealing rocky head, and rich hop aroma wafting from the glass. â€œThey sure dosed it with a lot of hops...[thereâ€™s] a lot of hop bitterness in the taste,â€ one taster observed.
In addition to the Imperial-level hopping, Hop Henge also boasts Imperial-level alcohol content, with 8.1% a.b.v.
This was the top-rated beer during its tasting session, and tasters had to dig deep for new superlatives to describe it. â€œThis is a beautiful beer,â€ concluded taster Gregg Glaser. â€œFull of flavor and hops and malt and hops again.â€
â€œNot for the timid,â€ said taster Robert Lachman.

Our first beer brewed right here at Flyers.  This ale has brownish red hues with a mild maltiness balanced by an herbal hop character without being bitter.
As the name implies, a rich deep brown ale in color with dark amber highlights.  The flavor is slightly sweet with hints of nuts and toffee finishing smooth with no after taste.
A robust porter in style, a dark and full bodied ale with hints of roasted barley and flavors of coffee and bitter sweet chocolate on the palate.
A rich and very dark Imperial Stout that has a complex flavor profile with hints of molasses and caramel.  Brewed in July to allow time for aging, Sick Duck finishes very smooth for such a big beer.
Clean, crisp, easy drinking Colonge, Germany style ale. Kolsch's smoothness comes from special Kolsch yeast, German Hallertau hops, a slow fermentation and lager like conditioning.
This is a hybrid of ale and mead made with 51% malted barley (Pale and Munich malted barley) and 49% Orange blossom honey, it is lightly hopped, spiced with Hibiscus flowers and fermented with Australian ale yeast.

Our Milton, DE microbrewery brewer Jon Talkington came up with this beer because of his love of different kinds of meads and his interest in Nordic lore and mythology.  The name Beewolf is the name Beowulf translated, meaning bear.
 
Color- light amber.
Aroma- Pear like fruitiness, with a clean malt and floral honey nose.
Flavor- sweet malt and honey with a subtle fruitiness and a hint of caramel.
ABV 7.0%
IBU's 25

Due to the limited availability of Beewolf Braggot, we are sorry that we are not able to offer growlers to go.
This was the first draught on tap in November 2001. It has developed to a very quaffable ale. the slight sweet malt flavor is balanced with East Kent Golding hops to produce this delicious reddish-amber ale.
This dark full bodied stout is perfect with a meal or as a meal. Rolled oats give this beer an enjoyable mouthfeel while chocolate and roasted malts lend to its distinctive flavor.
The perfect thirst quenching summertime ale. The subtle flavor of kiwi and strawberry blend with traditional German wheat and hops. Great for a hot summer day.
Another one of our first recipes, which we have improved with experience. This ale is pleasantly malty with nutty and toffee like undertones. East Kent Golding hops were used to compliment this English style ale.
This traditional German-style wheat beer is rich in banana and clove undertones, with a wonderful frothy head.
Bube's rendition of this classic style is made with fine 2-row malted barley and West Coast hops. A wonderful malt finish with a delicate citrus aroma, reminiscent of its Old-World cousin.
Red and white wheat combined with darker malts add body to this hazy, unfiltered ale.  Fermented with the same yeast as DreamWeaver Wheat replicating the pepper, clove and all-spice flavors found in our year-round beer.
Next up, we present Scratch Beer #11-2008, a Bitter. Back in the day, we used to brew a little number called TrÃ¶egs ESB. Even though this beer was retired almost six years ago, we still get numerous TrÃ¶egs old-schoolers (Martha) begging for its return.

Well hang onto your boot straps because Scratch #11 is about as close as we can get to the original ESB without firing up the old brew kettle. The Scratch #11 recipe originates from Chrisâ€™ stint at Englandâ€™s University of Sunderland brewing program. After returning to Colorado the brothers drew on Chrisâ€™ experience and brewed pilot batches tweaking that recipe. The ESB production recipe has direct bloodlines to these pilot batches.

The Thames Valley ale yeast and the roasted barley create a biscuit flavor with nutty undertones. Combining these flavors with the earthiness of East Kent Golding hops creates one hell of a fine session beer. Take in the deep mahogany beauty of this beer and breathe in the full hoppy nose. Itâ€™s not the ESB, but itâ€™s damn special.
he third time just might be the charmâ€”Scratch #10-2008 is our third triple in the Scratch Beer series.

This grand cru has been lovingly aged since late-February, yet still unleashes the slightest hint of alcohol heat.

Scratch #10-2008 also has a triple flavor inspiration combining the caramel/toffee notes of dememera sugar and molasses, with citrus and licorice flavors created by the orange peel and star anise; lastly we create a peppery/spicy finish with the same trappist yeast has been used in each Scratch Beer Triple.
Revisiting Scratch #3, we take the same Tripel recipe, add beet and cane sugars to the kettle, and run the wort through our hopback brimming with juniper berries, coriander and yarrow flowers.

Inspired by the herbaceous nose of gin, the berries and flowers give a slight pine/citrus aroma with floral undertones. Scratch #8 has a dry, yeasty finish and noticeable alcohol warming when consumed.
Old world brewing techniques combine with Noble hops for Scratch #6-2007.
This Export Lager features a single stage decoctionâ€”a first for TrÃ¶egs Brewery. After combining barley and water we transfer a portion of the mash to the brew kettle for a quick boil. The heated mash is then returned to the mash kettle and the brewing process continues. This process deepens the malt character and adds a subtle toffee backbone to this delicious lager.

Weâ€™ve added Magnum hops for bittering and Czech Saaz hops for aroma to create a classic European Noble hop flavor. 

Scratch #6-2007 is unfiltered, so there will be a slight haze to the beer.



Arrogant Bastard Ale aged in oak barrels.
Surviving beer from the Dortmunder Hansa-Brauerei before being acquired by Actien.
It is a nice example of a Hefeweizen.
Think of Guinness but with a "smooth bite" to it. This is a wonder beer for those of us who enjoy a porter.
It does have a nice hint of wheat and blueberries to it.
It is a good clean hefe.
A deep, mahogany ale brewed with beet sugar, green raisins, and Belgian-style yeast. As complex as a fine, red wine. Voted "American Beer of the Year" in January 2000 by Malt Advocate Magazine.
A strong ale brewed with a ridiculous amount of pureed raspberries (over a ton of em!).
Lawnmower is our intro for those who need a little help jumping feet first into the crazy world that is Dogfish Head beer.

It's a starter beer, but it's not dumbed down. Lawnmower is made with quality ingredients and is a great thirst quencher - perfect to enjoy after a day in the sun mowing the lawn (or anything else that gets you hot and bothered)!

Draft-Only, Limited Distribution
This beer is based on chemical analysis of pottery fragments found in Honduras which revealed the earliest known alcoholic chocolate drink used by early civilizations to toast special occasions.  The discovery of this beverage pushed back the earliest use of cocoa for human consumption more than 500 years to 1200 BC.  As per the analysis, Dogfish Headâ€™s Theobroma (translated into 'food of the gods') is brewed with Aztec cocoa powder and cocoa nibs, honey, chilies, and annatto (fragrant tree seeds).
A belgian-style Strong ale fermented with blackberries and blueberries.
A big, belgian-style Wit brewed with coriander and orange peel and fermented with Pinot Noir juice. After fermentation a fraction of the batch is aged in Oregon Pinot Noir barrels, and another fraction is aged on oak staves. The beer is blended together before packaging.

This has been one of our most popular Limited Edition beers at both our Rehoboth Beach, DE brewpub and at festivals. It successfully marries the refreshing citrusy qualities of a Belgian-style white beer with the robust complexity of a bold red wine.
Brewed with luscious apricots, finished with whole-leaf hops. A "fruit beer for hop heads..." Ale Street News

From Brewery's site:

With his gold label and Special Premium Reserve appellation, Ichiban outclasses and outperforms.

In 1990, Ichiban's debut made a splash in the world of super premium beers. The luxurious single wort (or first press) process yields a unique, complex flavor. With his gold label and "Special Premium Reserve" appellation, Ichiban outclasses and outperforms. But don't be fooled by a snooty attitude -- this is a great beer that goes with anything.

What makes Ichiban great
Prominent wort. Finest barley malt, premium hops, smooth finish, no bitter aftertaste.
From Kirin's Site:

With just 95 calories and full-flavor, Kirin Light is one of the few great world-class Lights.

You might think Kirin Light would be a lightweight contender, content to let his sturdier siblings steal the show. But this fitness-minded newcomer won't compromise. You won't have to compromise either - with just 95 calories and full flavor, Kirin Light is one of the few great world-class lights.

9000 year old Chateau Jiahu stands apart as the most ancient, chemically-attested alcoholic beverage in the world. Its recreation is based on painstaking excavation by Chinese archaeologists of Jiahuin the Yellow River basin, state-of-the-art microanalysis of pottery residues by American laboratories, and the inspired "Neolithic" brewing of Dogfish Head Craft Brewery. Chateau Jiahu, then as now, opens a window into the world of our ancestors.
When the British introduced draught pale ale to America, the Pipe Organ Pale Ale is what they had intended. It is truly British in character. Brewed with pale ale malt and a touch of caramel malt, it has a light copper color and subtle body. The maltiness is carefully balanced with only the best English hops - East Kent Goldings. Although this beer has a fair amount of hops, the caramel maltiness perfectly balances its profile.
Gold Medal Winner of the Great American Beer Festival. Our beer is fairly dark in color, but donâ€™t be afraid. It is a perfect example that dark beers are not always strong beers. The body is surprisingly mellow, and the alcohol content is a bit lower than most people might think. It has a wonderfully clean and roasty aroma. Hop bitterness levels are kept in line, but is has a noticeable hop flavor.
A Belgian Trippel is a very special type of beer. A Belgian Trippel could be called the beer version of a Champagne. It is very light in color and highly carbonated giving an appearance similar to Champagne. The flavor is somewhat sweet and malty as well as strong.
This beer is golden in color with a light bubbly effervescence. The light body makes this lager beer appropriate for a business lunch or your evening sipping beer. The light malt flavor also accentuates the hop flavor. From the start, you will notice a fine hop aroma. As you sip the Celestial Gold, the subdued maltiness blends with a slight hop flavor. When this beer finishes, you will notice a pleasant hop bitterness. The bitterness will be mild and quite appropriate. Celestial Gold has been known to induce Celestial bliss.
Stouts have typically been a staple beverage in the UK.  There are many variations of stouts available. You can find dry stouts, milk stouts, Imperial stouts, American stouts, and even stouts made with oats.

At the Church Brew Works we have crafted delicious Toasted Oatmeal Stout.  The oats were blended with the best barley malt we have â€“ and we didnâ€™t stop there.  To give this beer a wonderful roasted flavor, we added unmalted, very darkly roasted barley.  The roasted barley is mixed with a generous portion of chocolate colored malt giving the Blast Furnace Stout a beautiful ruby hue.

We used our finest hops unsparingly to create a delicately balanced bitterness with a rich roastiness and fresh hop aroma. The Fuggles and East Kent Goldings hops were added with heavy hands at two different times.  This unbridled addition grants a full hop flavor to our heavenly drink.

A typical oatmeal stout is a bit lower in alcohol than most other stouts as does the Blast Furnace Stout.  Ours, though not typical, does have a welcome medium body.  As you drink this beer, notice the rich, creamy brown head.  Drink it slowly and savor the flavors.  We donâ€™t think you will be disappointed.  Beer is not just for breakfast anymore.
Our Oktoberfest is a light amber colored beer.  It is malty in both flavor and aroma making it a delicate beer which is very drinkable. The hop bitterness is kept low to accentuate the maltiness.  Notice the crisp clean character and enjoy.  We brewed three batches of this beer so that we can bottle some of it in order to enhance our bottle beer selection.
A bock beer is required by German law to start at 17Â°Plato.   For those who are interested, Â°Plato is a measurement of the sugar content before fermentation.  It is a very malty lager beer with medium hop bitterness.  A maibock is a light to amber colored bock beer.  A Maibock is very similar to a Helles/pale bock.  Maibocks were originally brewed for the coming of spring, hence the name Mai (German for May).  The Mad Brewer Maibock is medium amber in color.  Though similar in color to our Pipe Organ Pale Ale, it is very different in character.  Donâ€™t let it get you though, itâ€™s a very strong beer at about 7% alcohol. It has a very clean and malty nose.  The hop bitterness is evident, but not dominant.  The Mad Brewer Maibock will finish quite full and have a delicate sweetness.
Iâ€™m sure everyone here knows, Pittsburgh has some humid summers.  What can you do to escape the heat and enjoy yourself?  Well Iâ€™ve got the answer.  How about a light thirst quenching Hefe Weizen (pronounced hefa Vite zen) in the cool environment of our Hop Garden patio.  I can hear you wondering, what is a hefe weizen?  Allay your fears my friends because Iâ€™m going to tell you.  A hefe weizen is a special style of beer made with malted wheat and malted barley.  Hefe weizens are from Germany.  This beer is top fermented (an ale) with a very special yeast.  The Hop levels are kept deliberately low in order to bring out the character of the yeast.  If you notice the nose of the beer, it has a clove-like or fruity aroma.  The grain bill includes 50% wheat malt and 50% barley malt.  It is served very carbonated and a touch cloudy.  It is cloudy because it is served unfiltered.  The remaining yeast contributes flavor, adds B vitamins, and improves the beer as it ages.
In our never-ending pursuit of answering the burning question of whatâ€™s new, we present Scratch #12-2008, an IPA.
 
The IPA is a fickle beast; too much malt and you veer into a high-octane hopbomb, while too little hops can question a beerâ€™s virility. In these chaotic days of shrinking hop harvests, balance is key to a proper IPA. Scratch #12-2008 delivers an intense pine nose married with a subtle wildflower aroma. The Thames Valley yeast adds an earthy nod to traditional English IPAs, while the American hops provide a bold contrasting bitterness.
 
Breath deep, relax, enjoy.

Brewed from very similar ingredients as the Red, but paler and spiced differently. It is intended only to be drunk at the abbey or at the nearby inn Auberge de PoteauprÃ© which is associated with the abbey. The monks themselves drink this variety rather than the stronger three. The DorÃ©e is not sold commercially and the rare bottles which make their way out are through unofficial sources. Even the brewery's own web site makes no mention of this variety.

Fish need cool clean water. So do you. Thatâ€™s why we sourced Salmon-Safe certified Sterling hops for our first organic beer. The way these flavorful, rich hops are grown makes sure that streams are shaded and there is not runoff to nearby waterways. That way the rivers stay cool and clean for migrating salmon. Not only is our Green Lakes beer organic, it helps protect our rivers as well.

Gordon is a hybrid version of strong ale, somewhere between an Imperial Red and a Double IPA. We make it with six different malts and three types of hops, then dry-hop it with a mutha lode of Amarillo hops. It is 8.7% alcohol by volume, and has 85 International Bittering Units. 

It features a gooey, resiny aroma and a luscious mouthfeel. Gordon is brewed with dash of chocolate malt in it, to round out its load of hops and balance the beer. The result is an assertive yet exceptionally smooth version of strong beer.

We brew Gordon in tribute to the late Gordon Knight. In addition to opening some of Coloradoâ€™s first microbreweries, Knight was a Vietnam vet, grade-A citizen, and huge promoter of craft beer. He lost his life in 2002 while fighting a wild fire outside of Lyons, Colorado.

Originally our winter seasonal beer, it has become a cult favorite of extreme-beer lovers, so we now brew occasional batches of Gordon throughout the year. Released in bottles in 2003 and 2004, Gordon is now sold in four packs of hand-labeled cans and on draft in select markets.

Dale's Pale Ale is our flagship beer and America's first hand-canned craft beer. It's an assertive but deftly balanced beer (somewhere between an American pale ale and an India Pale Ale) brewed with hefty amounts of European malts and American hops.

It features a merengue-like head, a copper color, and a hoppy nose, thanks to a big post-boil addition of Centennial hops. To complement its hoppy first impression, Dale's also sports a rich middle of malts and hops, and a bracing finish. Dale's is 6.5% alcohol by volume, and features 65 International Bittering Units.

We think of it as the perfect, everyday beer for hopheads like us. Dale's Pale Ale's rich flavor has helped us make many new fans, and its numerous honors have helped us kick huge holes in the misconceptions regarding cans.
Old Chub is a Scottish strong ale brewed with hearty amounts of seven different malts, including crystal and chocolate malts, and a smidge of US and UK hops. Old Chub also gets a dash of beechwood-smoked grains imported from Bamburg, Germany, home of the world's greatest smoked beers. Old Chub is 8% alcohol by volume.  While Dale's satisfies our hop addiction, Old Chub takes care of our deep affections for malt.  The cola-colored beer (almost black) features a tan head, a creamy, skim-milk mouthfeel, and rich, semi-sweet flavors of caramel and chocolate throughout. The addition of smoked grains gives Old Chub a delicate kiss of smoke on the finish.  Old Chub is the beer equivalent of a lightly smoked single malt scotch, or your favorite dark chocolate. We call it Rocky Mountain Mutha's Milk. People who tell us defiantly, "I don't drink dark beer," often fall deeply in love with Old Chub. We can't blame them.
Ten FIDY Imperial Stout - Now (11-21-07) available in cans, our winter seasonal beer is immensely viscous and loaded with neck-deep flavors of chocolate, malt, coffee, cocoa and oats.

It's the beer equivalent of decadently rich milkshake made with malted-milk balls and Heavenâ€™s best chocolate ice cream. Ten FIDY is about 10% ABV and is made with enormous amounts of two-row malts, chocolate malts, roasted barley, flaked oats and hops. Its huge-but-comforting flavors hide a whopping 98 IBUs that are deftly tucked underneath the beerâ€™s mountains of malty goodness.

Ten FIDY is the ultimate Rocky Mountain winter warmer, and further proof of the creative muscle of our beloved brewing staff. Look for fourpacks of Ten FIDY in select beer stores in Colorado. Out of state? We hope to send a few cases to a few of our other states in early '08.

Our Anniversary Ale this year stems from 2 pilot beers that were brewed by members of Team Stone. The first was Jeremy Moynierâ€™s incredibly delicious Oatmeal Stout, and the second was Jake Ratzkeâ€™s amazing homebrewed Imperial Stout that had authentic Oaxacan chocolate added to the boil. We loved both beers so much that we decided to combine the recipes to make this yearâ€™s Anniversary offering: Stone 12th Anniversary Bitter Chocolate Oatmeal Stout. This beer pours deep black with a rich brown head of foam. The aroma is dominated by roast malt and cocoa. Upon tasting, the cocoa (we used unsweetened, unprocessed cacao sourced through our friends at Chuao Chocolatier) really comes through with a deep chocolate flavor and a long lasting bitter finish. The roasted grains used add coffee and licorice accents. It is a thick beer, but not sweet, with the addition of oatmeal in the mash providing a rich, silky mouthfeel that adds to the creamy texture.
Stone 10th Anniversary IPA harkens back to our earlier Anniversary Ales, with abundant hopping at many stages of the brewing process. Appropriately, the aroma is over-the-top, with pronounced piney and resiny hop flavors combined with tropical fruit esters and more subtle notes of toasted malts and alcohol. Our Stone 10th Anniversary Ale weighs in at 10% alcohol by volume (perfect for a 10th anniversary beer), and has a little more color and malt character than our other IPAs. In addition to using the new Summit hop variety in the brewhouse to provide the powerful bitterness, we went back through our records and found some of our favorite hops over the years, and used them to flavor this brew, including Chinook, Crystal, and large doses of Simcoe in the dry-hop to provide a huge, complex, piney, fruity and floral hop character. This is a colossal beer, big in every sense: hoppy, malty, rich, and strong! Right up our alley.

This is truly a tasty adult beverage!


Wouldn't it suck to have a job where nobody likes you? And, regardless of your name, people always call you Rita, as in "Lovely Rita?" Sometimes people just shorten it to the simpler "meter maid." The funny thing about that is the Webster dictionary defines a "meter maid" as "a female member of a police department who is assigned to write tickets for parking violations." You have to wonder how the male "meter maids" feel about that! Parking Violation is an American style pale ale using lots of American hops, lots of quarters, and several trips back and forth to the parking lot. So, remember to drink responsibly and feed your meter.
"If you can't feel good about your beer... what else is worth feeling good about."
We call Beer Esteem a California Common because it is brewed with a lager yeast and it is fermented at warmer ale temperatures. However, Beer Esteem is distinctly different from other California Commons.

RIDE Belgian-style Strong Pale Ale boasts a glorious deep gold color and an amazing yet arrogant head. Plentiful pale malt creates beautiful, agile body. Assertive hops and Belgian yeast achieve charismatic floral and spice notes in aroma and flavor. But Prideâ€™s predominant and unique character comes from its exposure to Brettanomyces in French oak Chardonnay barrels. At once tart and refreshing yet earthy and musty, Pride is unlike most beers on earth. And itâ€™s bitter, lingering finish demands another sip. 

Awarded a BRONZE medal at World Beer Cup 2008, Pride has much too much to boast about.
SLOTH Belgian-style Imperial Stout is deliberately dark as hell. The pour is slow and sluggish. Its head is menacing, becoming torn and tattered Belgian lace on the sides of the glass as you cautiously consume this brewâ€”sip by insidious sip.

With a summer release in mind, GREED Belgian-style Single was created miserlyâ€”relatively speakingâ€”with one type of malt and two varieties of hops. At 5% ABV and 30 IBUs, Greed is the lightest in our series of 2007 Deadly Sin Beers. However, the Belgian yeast used in fermentation and conditioning contributes an earthy, somewhat spicy flavor and a crisp finish. We invite you to be greedy before itâ€™s gone. 

GREED...Less [for you] is More [for me].

This beer was brewed using only American malts, American hops, and American yeast. Who says you have to import ingredients from Germany to make a true Pilsner?

The name CascaZilla is a play on both the name of our local Cascadilla Gorge and the monster amounts of Cascade hops in this beer. This red ale gets its distinctive color from a healthy portion of caramel malt, which also lends some body and sweetness to the beer.

Porter is our darkest beer, but not necessarily our strongest.  It is widely held that the darker the beer, the stronger the beer, but this is a summarily false.  The contribution of color comes directly from the color of malt that we use.  Some malt is oasted to achieve dark color and coffee-like flavor which in turn get transferred to the beer.

Our Porter is ruchly complex with overtones of chocolate and expresso beans followed by a subtle flavor of hops.  It's a nourishing beer without being too sweet or filling.
Don't let Tripel's light color and delicate aroma fool you, this is one serious beer brewed with maximum effort.  First, we introduce the freshest barley to crystal filtered water.  Second, we add the best hops shipped directly from Europe.  Third, our special yeast is the catalyst for fermentations, gobbling sugar and creating alcohol as it works.  

Some say that the Belgian monks who first brewed this style called it triple to denote it's high alcohol content.  Still others believe triple's origins lay in its triple fermentations; twice in the brewery and once in the bottle.  Whatever the answer, ours is the Tripel threat.

This Belgian IPA has a malt bill of a Belgian Tripel and a hop bill of a Double IPA. The yeast I chose for this beer comes from one of the 7 Trappist breweries.

Believe it or not, this is the first time in my professional brewing career that I have used dextrose (corn syrup) in a Terrapin brew. True to style no doubt.

â€œMonkâ€™s Revengeâ€ (otherwise known as the â€œBig Nastyâ€) has all the flavor and aroma of a Double IPA while hidden beneath lies the malt character of a fine Belgian Tripel.

I hope you enjoy my interpretation of this very fun style.

Sixpoint Bengali Tiger is reminiscent of the century-old English IPA. In my perspective, many current IPAs suffer from lacking substance; unbalanced by a hoppy assertiveness that is not substantiated by a strong foundation of rich malt flavors. Our interpretation uses the highest-quality, floor-malted base malt, which lends a full-bodied and rich caramel flavor. We mash at high temperatures and add generous amounts of specialty malts to further emphasize a strong foundation of malt as leverage for our generous additions of hopsâ€¦ Which are indeed generous. We use a total of three different hop strains, and add a total of six different additions throughout the process. The Bengali Tiger has a hoppy snap upfront, but strides at a steady pace, and finishes balanced. The signature characteristic of the Tiger is the aromaâ€¦ we use massive quantities of whole East Kent Goldings hops to dry hop in our conditioning tanks. The result? The essential oils from the hops are an enticing treat before every sip. Notice the lacing of stripes around the pint glass as you finish your glass; itâ€™s the mark of the Tiger.

A touch of hops rounds out its silky, full body, highlighting Ridgelineâ€™s subtle but engrossing character. Show your friends that you care about their taste buds by turning them on to our imminently balanced and perfectly complex Ridgeline Amber. 

Of interest to Great Divide historians â€“ Ridgeline originally debuted at the brewery as Great Divideâ€™s first beer, Arapahoe Amber. It was renamed in 2004 to better reflect the Colorado lifestyle that Great Divideâ€™s beers perfectly complement.

What better way to surprise a beer lover than with a fruit beer that tastes like beer? Nine years ago, we began our quest to provide beer lovers with a worthy fruit beer, by rolling out Wild Raspberry Ale. Our mantra is that real fruit makes real beer, so we ferment Wild Raspberry Ale with hundreds of pounds of real red and black raspberries. We steadfastly refuse to fall prey to extracts and cheap syrups. Sure, squirting syrup into a keg of beer and rolling it around on the floor is easy, but the taste is...  fake! Over the past nine years, we have stayed true to our commitment to real fruit, no matter what the time, expense, or late season frosts have thrown our way. One year, Mother Nature delivered a late cold snap that was so severe, we had to pre-order 85% of the harvestable U.S. black raspberry crop, just to meet the demand for Wild Raspberry Ale.

Our efforts do not go unrewarded â€“ Wild Raspberry Ale is a truly effervescent, ruby red ale that achieves the almost impossible balance between malted barley and tart raspberry fruitiness. Its naturally tart character makes Wild Raspberry the ultimate accompaniment to spicy Mexican food or on its own as a stand-alone session beer.
Hades is a Belgian-style strong golden ale brewed with a rare Belgian yeast strain that gives the beer a distinctive spicy flavor and aroma. Noticeable hops and medium malt character make it an extremely well-balanced, crisp ale.

Not to be boastful, but we honestly believe that all other ales pale in comparison to this one. Brewed with pilsner malt, Philadelphia Pale Ale is crisp and hoppy, bursting with citrus flavors and aromas.

Philadelphia Pale Ale was named one of the best Pale Ales in the country by the New York Times.
Crafted from the finest ingredients and originally intended for the cask-ale connoisseur, Extra Special Ale is a robust and hearty amber ale with a malt body and aromatic hop finish.

Straight from the heart of the City of Brotherly Love comes a dark and chocolatey seductive little stout dominated by roasted malt flavor. This is one Philly favorite that won't break your heart and will always love you back.
Ever met a New Belgium Beer Ranger? They are our beloved folks out in the field. Spanning all 26 of our states from the Pacific to the Atlantic, our Beer Rangers do their best to protect, to pour and to partake. And explore many a beer from many a brewery, they do. The fellows up in the Northwest kept calling for â€œmore hops!â€ Soon it became a common theme across the land. Rangers, fans and craft lovers everywhere were searching for hoppier beers. 

So, here it finally is â€“ New Belgiumâ€™s foray into the true American India Pale Ales. Bring out the hops! This clear amber beauty bursts at the starting gate with an abundance of hops: Cascade (citrus), Chinook (floral/citrus), and Simcoe (fruity) lead off the beer, with Cascade added again for an intense dry hop flavor. Brewed with pale and dark caramel malts that harmonize the hop flavor from start to finish, Ranger is a sessionable splendor for all you hopinistas. Thank your Beer Ranger!
Brewed to celebrate Ben's 300th birthday.

Whether Ben Franklin ever said, "Beer is living proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy" is up for debate. Some say he said it, others say he didn't. No one knows for sure. 

Historical facts or fictions aside, Yards Brewing Company has recreated Poor Richard's Tavern Spruce Aleâ„¢ to celebrate Franklin's affinity for fine ales. Poor Richard's Tavern Spruce Ale is based on Franklin's original recipe, which called for spruce essence and molasses, as barley and hops were not readily available at the time.

All beers are not created equal.

While Thomas Jefferson spent much of his time in Philadelphia drafting, editing, revising, and re-editing the Declaration of Independence, he longed to be home in Monticello, where twice a year his wife Martha would brew up one of his favorite beverages â€” beer.

Thomas Jefferson Tavern Aleâ„¢ is a strong golden ale, based on Jefferson's original recipe, which included ingredients specified and grown on his Virginia estate.

We have added natural raspberry flavor to our UFO Hefeweizen to create this beer.  Consistent with the hefeweizen style, this beer is unfiltered and cloudy with a solid foamy head.  UFO Raspberry has a distinctive, hazy rose color.  The scent of fresh raspberries hits the nose immediately, along with a subtle bready aroma from the wheat and yeast.  The body is light and the unfiltered yeast provides a soft mouthfeel.  The taste of the fruit compliments the beer nicely, neither overwhelms the other.  There is a faint sweetness on the palate, which finishes cleanly in a semi-dry, tart finish.
Harpoon Brown is brewed to accentuate the sweeter, rounder notes derived from six different malts, including a de-husked chocolate malt that adds a hint of chocolate. The blend of these malts produces a beer that is complex and delicious without being heavy. This drinkable beer is perfect as a session beer or paired with foods.

This is the first year-round Harpoon beer the brewery has released in almost a decade.  While the craft beer industry has seen a growing trend in "extreme" beers, the brewers of Harpoon wanted to create something they could sit down and enjoy over an extended period of time - a session beer.  At 4.3% alcohol by volume, the Harpoon Brown Ale has the lowest alcohol content of all Harpoon beers.

Harpoon Brown Ale will be available in bottles and on draft beginning in March 2007.  An evening of celebrations to toast the beer's release will be held at locations throughout New England on Thursday, March 8th, including tastings at Harpoon's breweries in Boston, MA and Windsor, VT
As winter begins its slide toward the sunny days of spring, we bring you Glissade Golden Bock to help you enjoy the ride. Glissade is a remarkably mellow take on the traditional spring bock. With restrained sweetness, we emphasize subtle malt flavor, balanced against delicate aromas of spicy and floral European hops. This complex balance helps Glissade slide across the palateâ€”bracing us against the last cold nights of winter, while its bright golden color turns our thoughts toward spring.
Harpoon Munich Dark is a blend of dark malts that creates a deeper hue than some other beers brewed in this style. The grains which create a malty chocolate-like flavor also add a warm malty nose that mingles with the subtle hop aroma. This medium bodied beer is balanced quite well with a moderately bitter hop finish.




Our fourth in the Firehouse Ales Series, Pompier means "fireman" in French and represents our continued commitment to celebrate and honor the men and women who respond to the call day after day.  Pompier is rich and  smooth with complexities that come from a huge grain bill comprised of premium imported specialty malts, French Strisselspalt aroma hops and a 3 month aging process in oak hogsheads where it is combined with toasted French oak wood chips and champagne yeast.  Pompier is intended to be a vintage quality English-Style Barleywine with a French twist.  Appreciate its fine character and 12.1%ABV when we release this single 10 barrel batch sometime in December or you may choose to cellar it for many years to come.  

You will find Pompier on retail shelves packaged in the same 1 Liter Swing-Top bottle that has become a signature for our specialty beers.





ach and every fall, we experience a coastal experience in San Diego known as the "Super High Tide." This happens later in the Fall Season when the tidal swings reach a range of about 8 feet in difference between low and high tides. When this happens, there are days when the tide just gets too high and flattens out the surf. The lineups shut down and surfers are left to wait until the High Tide recedes.

While waiting for the tides to shift in your favor, might we suggest a High Tide IPA? Brewed only once each year to coincide with the Hop Harvest in Yakima Washington, High Tide IPA is made with 180 lbs of Fresh Hops per batch that are plucked from the vines and sent straight to our brewery. We skip the whole drying and processing stage which means the hops are ultra fresh and full of flavors we can't normally get. Like grapes, Hops are only harvested one time each year and as such, we make what we can when we get them.
Yellow Snow IPA was originally introduced for the 2000 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.

Yellow Snow is Rogueâ€™s tribute to winter sports everywhereâ€”downhill skiing, snowboarding, cross country, ice hockey, ice fishing, snowmobiling, and even curling. 

It will be available November 1st in select states where mountains and snow can be found.

Pale golden in color with a hoppy fruity aroma. Big hop flavor up front complemented by medium body and hoppyness mid-pallet. Finishes with a characteristic lingering bitterness.

Purple Haze is a crisp, American style wheat beer with raspberry puree added after filtration. Therefore, you may see raspberry pulp in the beer. The raspberries provide the lager with a subtle purple coloration and haze, a fruity aroma, and a tartly sweet taste.
A full-bodied brown ale with smooth hints of pumpkin and brown sugar. Perfect to warm-up with, as the season cools.
Sierra Nevada Torpedo Ale is a big American IPA; bold, assertive and full of flavor and aromas highlighting the complex citrus, pine and herbal character of whole-cone American hops.

Named after the torpedo-shaped hopback employed in its making, is an IPA made with Chinook, Cascade and Centennial hops.
FiftyFifty's "Wit" beer, Foggy Goggle is a Belgian Style Wheat Beer, cousin of the German Hefeweizen. An unfiltered beer, Foggy Goggle is brewed true to style, using a yeast strain that originated in Belgium, with just a hint of orange peel, lemon peel, and chamomile. The appearance is an opaque yellow with a wonderfully fluffy head. The predominant aroma is citrus with a hint of coriander, and a unique spicy note. With citrus playing a big part of the flavor, Foggy Goggle is a very refreshing choice.

A Scotch Ale, â€œbrewed with 100% Michigan barley and a blend of Pacific Northwest and Michigan hops.â€
Our fall seasonal is a subtle, well-balanced ale, copper in color, offering rich, full flavors and aromas of pumpkin and spices.
Sun Dog is an unfiltered beer, with a naturally cloudy appearance and fuller texture which allows it to stand up to spicy foods like Thai noodle salads and Cuban sandwiches.  The beer is best served in a tall, wide-mouthed glass which opens up the aromas of the beer and showcases its beautiful long-lasting head of white foam.
It is beer #2 in our "Blackwater Series" of original Imperial Stouts. The first in the Series was "Is", a dark and bitter Russian Imperial Stout. "Oat" is the follow up; an Oatmeal Stout with major alcohol volume and tons of body to back it up. The cloying character of the oats in this brew lends itself to a chewy and almost oily mouthfeel. ABV. is off the charts at about 12.5%. Note, that this is an all malt beer fermented with our house ale strain of yeast. Judicious hopping with Columbus and Chinook produce a hoppy aroma that mingles nicely with the chocolate and de-bittered black barley from Belgium.
Nothing beats a day at the beach...  the sun, the sand and, of course, the scenery. Here in Lake Mills, the three beaches of Rock Lake have drawn young and old for generations... to laugh, to play, to frolic, to just escape stresses of life for a time. Three Beaches Honey Blonde is like a day at the beach... light, bleached blonde, gleefully effervescent, free from bitterness and sure to improve your attitude. When you need a little attitude adjustment, spend a day at the beach with Three Beaches Honey Blonde... and you won't even have to wash the sand out of your suit!

Three Beaches Honey Blonde is our Wisconsin version of the American Blonde Ale. This beer is light-bodied with a sweet touch of honey and a mild citrus accent.
The ancient peoples that inhabited Wisconsin are known for building numerous celestial stone monuments and earthen effigy mounds to serve as symbols of their culture and their beliefs.  Unfortunately, most of these structures have fallen victim to the farmer's plow over the past 150 years.  Not far from the brewery, lying preserved on the floor of Rock Lake, are two effigy mounds - a Headless Man and a Turtle.  Legend tells us, as the Turtle can survive on both land and in water, its spirit helped guide the Headless Man into the afterlife.  May the Turtle's spirit guide you to happiness with a Headless Man Amber Alt.

The Headless Man is brewed in the "old way" of a DÃ¼sseldorf-style Altbier.  A unique cold lagering process gives this amber ale its smooth taste.
Deep in the darkest depths of Rock Lake prowls a great saurian known today as Rocky.  The legend of Rocky is old.  The ancient inhabitants of Aztalan warned of the beast by building a giant serpent mound at the lakeâ€™s edge.  The early residents of Lake Mills were forewarned of a guardian placed in the lake to protect its sacred stone tepees.  And history tells of numerous encounters with Rocky, who became a source of great worry and fear.  Although not seen for over a century, divers still experience a feeling of dread and being watched.  Enjoy Rockyâ€™s Revenge, our offering to this legendary protector of Tyranena.

Rockyâ€™s Revenge is an American brown ale with a portion aged in bourbon barrels.  Each bourbon barrel will contribute its own unique character to this rich, satisfying ale.
The Fargo brothers arrived in Lake Mills in 1845, armed with a strong collective will and a pioneering spirit. The Fargo family became leaders in commerce, industry, agriculture, civics and religion. Through the years, these hard working men and their families shaped the character and very essence of our beautiful hometown. Their legacy endures in the buildings and businesses they built and the civility they brought to this city. In this same pioneering spirit, we brew our Fargo Brothers Hefeweizen to honor this "first family" of Lake Mills.

Fargo Brothers Hefeweizen is brewed in the tradition of a Bavarian-style weiÃŸbier with a clove-like flavor and aroma with banana undertones and no bitterness.  The unfiltered yeast makes this beer cloudy.
Gemuetlichkeit translates from German as "the fondness of feasting, drinking and merry company."  This is true of most everyone in Wisconsin, especially those of us at the brewery.   Each September in the nearby city of Jefferson, Wisconsin, thousand turn out for Gemuetlichkeit Days, a celebration of the area's German heritage.  We invite you to celebrate the spirit of Gemuetlichkeit with us.  Don your lederhÃ¶sen, kick up your heels with a polka and raise a stein of our Gemuetlichkeit Oktoberfest with a friend.  Ein Prosit!

Gemuetlichkeit Oktoberfest is a rich, amber lager with a malty aroma and balanced hop bitterness.  This seasonal style is served at German Oktoberfests in liter steins.

In tribute to its namesake god of agriculture, SATURN celebrates a bountiful Pacific Northwest hop harvest. Ample malt sets the stage for this end-of-season party. Fresh Cascade and Centennial hops from Yakima Valley mingle with Belgian yeasts to impart abundant spice and earthiness.
Resinous hop character and bitterness balance the rich carmel malt base. We took it a step further and Amarillo dry-hopped the brew to 45 ibu's, creating refreshing and savory hop flavors and aromas. Is it red IPA? That's your call.

THE UGLY AMERICAN is a perfectly enjoyable classic Belgian Trippel corrupted almost beyond recognition with a completely inappropriate amount of US hops. Only in America can such excessive excesses be fully appreciated, celebrated, and enjoyed...and for now, only at East End Brewing! To make this one a little more cellar-able, and a lot more portable, it's going into the bottle.
A "Belgian White" wheat beer, gently spiced with (new!) coriander and bitter orange peel. Light bodied with hints of orange and lemon. A great beer for hot weather or for those looking for something lighter all year round.

Tavern Ale is a traditional English Bitter, dry bodied and light in color. This sessions ale utilizes Northdown and Kent Golding Hops. Tavern Ale is the creation of Assistant Brewer Adrian Bethel.
Bumppo's Brown Ale is a dark Dark Mild Ale. It is lightly hopped with a medium body, darkened and flavored with chocolate malt.
Cooper's Cave Pale Ale is an English Pale Ale throughout.It is a full bodied light colored ale with evenly pronounced hop bitterness. The grain bill consists of two English Pale Malts and an English Crystal Malt. The brewer's favorite...need we say more.
Pathfinder's Porter is a robust, dark and hoppy ale originally brewed for street urchins of London. Our version does the job for the Glens Falls urchins of today.
Cooper's Cave Ale Company's flagship ale is an Irish Red Ale. Three English Malts and one Belgian Munich Malt make up the grain bill. It is a full bodied Red Ale packed with flavor, blended with American Nugget hops for bitterness and East Kent Golding for flavor and aroma. This ale has turned the heads of many "dyed in the wool" American lager drinkers.
Sagamore Stout is a light, dry Irish Draught Stout. It is not only named for the street on which our brewery is located but also for the "Sagamore" of the Mohicans, the Chief Chingachgook. Best quaffed using a wide mouthed, full blown English Pint.
This beauty is a complete work of art! Bryan and I picked 22 lbs of fresh Cascade hops from 3 gigantic hop vines Bryan has at his house. Hops produce an overabundance of hop cones and we were there for the picking. Even after 22 lbs, we hardly put a dent in the yield! So...here we are 3 weeks later, the beer is on tap and it is the freshest...hoppiest...flavorful beer you can imagine! Needless to say, we are proud of this beauty from the ground, up! We wanted a full-flavored IPA, so Bryan suggested we use our Requiem IPA recipe, and calculate for fresh, whole hop cones. Worked beautifully!! We ended up with an IPA with so much up-front flavor you would think you are enjoying a high octane Imperial! Instead, this is a middle-of-the-road IPA, at 5.2% abv!! This just goes to show how a hugely flavorful IPA can be loaded-up with fresh ingredients and come out the other end, a tasty LOW octane, treat! Bryan and I hope you get to stop in soon to try this one out! We decorated Bube's with some of the actual hop vines we pulled from. For the true hophead, you will be in heaven. And for the all-around beer enthusiasts, we hope you can appreciate the creativity in this beer. I know I'm proud to say I had a hand in this one!!

It's our very first beer - golden medium-bodied and brewed as a traditional Munich Helles style pale lager. It features a rounded maltiness without being too heavy. And like every proud Texan, it has a good head, is pleaseant but never overly sweet.
Rahr's Red is a delicious, medium-bodied red lager. Notes of caramel with a sound malt character. Not too hoppy, very smooth.
Rahr's Buffalo Butt is a smooth, medium-bodied amber lager. Notes of caramel with a sound malt character. Nice hop finish, it's as smooth as a baby buffalo's...!
Ugly Pug is a schwarzbier, or black lager. But the real story is its name. Fritz saw his mother-in-lawâ€™s pug, Oscar, lounging in a chair and he (Fritz) shouted, â€œWhat an ugly pug!â€ Everyone laughed. Yourâ€™re right â€“ they were drinking a test batch that night.
During a fierce storm on his voyage across the ocean, William Rahr could be heard yelling from the tall masted ship: "Roll on old sea! And when you are done, when the storm clouds have destroyed themselves, we will still be standing and drinking!" Today, we have created the ultimate ale for a voyage such as this: A German-Style IPA - a traditional India Pale Ale with German Influence.
Blind Salamander Pale Ale is the first of a series of Rahr beers
called Rare Breed. These beers are dedicated to improving the lot of
endangered Texas species. Rahr is making donations from these proceeds
to the Texas Parks & Wildlife Foundation to help with the recovery
of these species. 

The Texas Blind Salamander is a rare cave dwelling troglobite amphibian native to San
Marcos, specifically the San Marcos Pool in the Edwards Aquifer. It has
bright red external gills for absorbing oxygen from the water. Its
mature length is 5 cm and its diet varies by what flows into its cave,
including shrimp, snails and amphipods. 

Blind Salamander Pale Ale is a blend of the finest pale malts and East Kent
Goldings hops. The fine balance of these toasted caramel malts and
earthy hops makes Blind Salamander an easy drinking and satisfying ale.
Bucking Bock - it's a traditional German Spring Bock Beer - golden in color and mildly hopped...... Kick'n in at 8% alcohol - it has a smooth malty character that will surely thaw you out after a long cold winter. Spring is here and so is Rahr's Bucking Bock!
There is nothing more refreshing than a cold SUMMERTIME WHEAT at the end of a hot Texas day. This refreshing, lightly hopped ale has unique banana and clove-like characteristics. It is unfiltered so the yeast character comes through with a light but full body.
"O'zapft is!" The cry of happy beer drinkers at the start of the Munich Oktoberfest, which in German means "The keg is tapped!" Rahr's Oktoberfest Celebration Lager is a traditional Marssen style Oktobefest lager - dark amber in color, super smooth, medium body with a sweet malty finish. True to tradition, this is a classic Oktoberfest Lager.
Warm up the long, cold nights of winter with Rahr's latest seasonal offering. Wonderfully robust, rich and full-bodied, Rahr's Winter Warmer is crated in the fine British tradition of holiday ales. Perfect for either holiday gatherings or quiet evenings at home.
This is a special edition of Rahr's Winter Warmer. This fine English ale has been aged in freshly emptied Kentucky oak whisky barrels. The barrel aging has given this already big ale a beautiful whiskey nose along with notes of vanilla and oak. A perfect ale for sipping around a winter fire.

From the French word â€œGardeâ€ meaning something worth keeping, this Biere de Garde styled Farmhouse Ale is a most delicious companion to a loaf of freshly baked bread from the oven. Grab a seat on the porch, some soft cheese and a tree ripened apple from your grandmotherâ€™s old orchard. Relax and watch the evening arrive as the afternoon sun is consumed by the illuminating moon over the gardens. We brewed Avant Garde for you, our friends and families. Hereâ€™s to things worth guarding over.
Lost and Found- Modeled after the great Trappist and Monastic beers that inspired the founding of our brewery. A richly deep garnet colored ale created from a blend of Domestic and imported malts. As part of our commitment to interesting brewing endeavors, Chef Vince created a special raisin puree for this beer. Malts, raisins and a fantastic yeast strain working in harmony produce a beer of amazing complexity and depth. Available in 750ml bottles and on draft at select inspired locations.
This Farmhouse Ale traces its roots to the small rustic breweries of Southern Belgium. The word Saison comes to us from the French language and it means Season. Lightly spiced with Organic Ginger, Orange Peels, Black Pepper and Grains of Paradise, this brew promises to quench your thirst on the hottest Southern California days or wherever your travels may take you. Available in 750 ml bottles and on draft at select inspired locations.
A massive beer in every sense of the word. A stronger and more contemplative version of our Lost and Found Ale. Judgment Day is the base beer for our Cuvee de Tomme. Many of the Trappist Breweries produce a version of beer which ages incredibly well for many years to come. And, since none of us knows when the end of the world is coming, we suggest you stock up with lots of Lost Abbey beers so that when the end of the world magically appears from no where, youâ€™ll have a beer or two on hand for even the stingiest of angels. Available in 750ml bottles and on draft at select inspired locations.
Itâ€™s an unassuming road leading to the priory. Here, off the corner of two intersecting roads, dedicated monks have been making beer for over 150 years. Itâ€™s always been a simple life â€“ the kind that requires they brew only enough to sustain the activities of their monastery. In the silence of passing seasons, they pray, they brew and retire in solitary existence behind the sheltering walls. They live a most interesting life. Most likely one we couldnâ€™t sustain.

Nearby, each summer, the trellised fields spring to life as rows of resinous green cones are trained toward the heavens. Rumor is some monks love these hops and being surrounded by budding yellow aromas and the leafy pungent fields inspired them. Since we arenâ€™t sensible enough to locate our brewery near hop fields, we can only offer this blond ale in celebration of our Abbey brethren and their steadfast Devotion.
The history of the bible and religion is indeed the struggle of good vs. evil. Our Serpentâ€™s Stout recognizes the evil of the dark side that we all struggle with. This is a massively thick and opaque beer that begs the saints to join the sinners in their path to a black existence. 10.5% ABV and available in 750 ml bottles and on draft at select locations.
Please enjoy Brooklyn Oktoberfest, a rich, malty version of the beer brewed for the fall festival which originated in Germany with the betrothal of the Crown Prince of Bavaria in 1810.

Daas Blond is the authentic Belgian strong golden beer, its honey spice aroma and perfect balance of bitter sweet flavours are followed by a classic dry hop finish.  A perfect aperitif beer.

Daas Beer is the only Belgian beer brewed in Belgium to carry both the  UK Soil Assoc organic certification and the Belgian Certsys certification whist still upholding its Belgian tradition of brewing excellence using the finest organic ingredients.
The Daas Organic Witte is very well received by women beer drinkers; it is a naturally cloudy Belgian wheat beer. Its fruity blend of subtle citrus (baked oranges) and spice (coriander) flavors compliment its crispy dry and bitter hop finish.
A bottle conditioned Saison with a spicy and moderately hoppy profile true to the traditions of the farmhouse ales of Wallonia.

 A spiced saison with chamomile, rosemary and black pepper.
Brewed in the spirit of the abbey ales of Belgium. Brewed with the same care and attention to the Art of Brewing that is practiced in the monastic breweries of Belgium.

A Belgian inspired amber. This beer gets itâ€™s color from the candi sugar, as it is made without dark or crystal malts.
Abita Turbodog is a dark brown ale brewed with Willamette hops and a combination of British pale, crystal and chocolate malts.

This combination gives Turbodog its rich body and color and a sweet chocolate-toffee like flavor. Turbodog began as a specialty ale but has gained a huge loyal following and has become one of our three flagship brews.

Just a bit stronger than our other brews, so . . .beware of the dog!
In Williamsburg, Brooklyn, we forge barley malt and hops from Germany, aromatic raw sugar from Mauritius and yeast from Belgium into our latest beer, Brooklyn Local 1.

Behind the full golden color you'll find an alluring aroma, a dynamic complex of flavors, Belgian flair, Brooklyn fortitude and a dusting of our special yeast. To create this beer, we use the old technique of 100% bottle re-fermentation, a practice now rare even in Europe. It gives this beer a palate of unusual depth. Enjoy it locally or globally, as an aperitif or with your favorite dishes. It is particularly nice with spicy seafood and with fine cheeses.
Pipeline Porter is smooth and dark with a distinctive roasty aroma and earthy complexity from its diverse blends of premium malted barley. This celebration of malt unites with freshly roasted 100% Kona coffee grown at Cornwell Estate on Hawaiiâ€™s Big Island, lending a unique roasted aroma and flavor. A delicate blend of hops rounds out this palate-pleasing brew.
This Belgian Ale is what you could call a wit with an attitude.  We are generous with all our ingredients - including both orange peel and coriander.  This does not stop this ale from being a good companion with seafood dishes.
A light session ale, with an assertive hop aroma of E K Golding.  Great beer to pair with lots of different food - a good allround.
We usually do not make compromises, but this is probably the exception.  Norwegians are dead scared of dark beers.  This is an attempt to show that there are gentle dark ales.  As such Havre Stout is smooth and drinkable.
One of our most refreshing brews, made for those hot summer days, but satisfying year 'round. Recommended serving temperature 8Â°C/45Â°F. Goes well with seafood, particularly oysters.
A rather malty brew, which we think goes very well with cheeses - even well matured blue cheeses. You can also try our Amber paired with a grilled dish. Recommended serving temperature 10Â°C/50Â°F.
There is a long story to this malty ale.  It was first brewed in the spring 2006 in NÃ¸rrebro Bryghus in Copenhagen, Denmark, as a joint brew between NÃ¸gne Ã˜ and NÃ¸rrebro.  NÃ¸rrebro calls their version â€œDouble Knot Brownâ€.  It is the perfect thing to drink with almost any cheese.
A rich, malty, and very bitter ale. Cascade hops provide a long, fruity, and spicy after-taste.  Recommended serving temperature 10Â°C/50Â°F.  Ideal with barbequed or smoked meat dishes.
Our 100th batch, brewed for the enjoyment of the brewers, but popular demand forced us to release it commercially.  This malty, yet light bodied ale has a massive hop bitterness.  Most enjoyable in a comfortable chair in front of a roaring fire.
St. Nicholas, aka Santa Claus, is a magical figure, the bringer of gifts and an icon of holiday spirit. Forgotten by most is his evil side kick and enforcer of â€˜the listâ€™. European tradition says while St. Nick is busy delivering presents to good little boys and girls, Krampus hands out punishments to the bad. A fanged, goat-horned bully, the Christmas Devil uses sticks and chains to beat the naughty children. Dark malts and aromatic hops create the diabolical spirit of this brew. It is finished with lager yeast and aged cold for no less than 30 days. This Imperial Helles Lager will warm even the darkest hearts. 

This season, replace the cookies with a bottle of Krampus. If he happens to pay a visit, toast to him with this devilish brew. Merry Kramp-mas to all, and to all a good pint!
9.0% abv. â€¢ 20Âº plato â€¢ Imperial Helles Lager â€¢ 22 oz / 1/6 keg
A classic American IPA with lots of floral punch and assertive hop presence. Hopped with Nugget, Palisade and Amarillo colored to a reddish hue thanks to Munich and Aromatic malts



Scratch #15-2008 is our first collaborative beer in the Scratch series. We teamed up with St. Thomas Roasters of Linglestown to create a Double Espresso Oatmeal Stout.

The double in the name refers to the espresso (not the alcohol). Scratch #15â€™s espresso blend is a medium city-type roast featuring beans from three continents. St. Thomas Roasters roasted and ground the beans; we used them in our hopback. At the end of the boil the hot wort passed through the espresso beans to give a lush coffee espresso nose and hints of coffee flavor.

Chocolate, roasted and caramel malt flavors stand out, while the addition of oats gives Scratch #15 a full, round mouth feel. Galena and Ken Goldings hops are added to balance the overall flavor and not drive up the bitterness. The head retention diminishes quickly because of the oils from the espresso beans.

We wanted to see if we could grow hops at our brewery in Chico, California so we planted our own hop field selecting our prized Cascade and Centennial varieties along with some specialty hop varieties to experiment with. To our surprise, we not only could grow hops, we were also able to harvest them in late summer due to Chicoâ€™s ideal climate. 

Chico Estate Harvest Ale is one of the very few estate harvest ales produced anywhere in the world today. All the hops in the beer are grown naturally on the premises of our brewery in Chico. We pick the hops ourselves and then take them directly to the brew kettle, without being dried, just after picking so they retain nearly all of their natural oils and resins. It is made with Cascade, Centennial and Chinook hops. Until now, this beer has only been available in draft. Starting this year, we will be bottling it on a very limited basis, with plans to expand its availability as we expand our Chico hop field in the coming years.
Our newest addition to our Harvest family is Southern Hemisphere Harvest. This is the first time we know of that an American brewer has put out a beer with fresh-picked hops from the southern hemisphere. The inaugural ale will debut in late April and will feature fresh Pacific Hallertau, New Zealand Motueka and New Zealand Southern Cross hops, all from New Zealand. 

Like our Celebration Ale, the fresh hops in this beer are dried right after being picked then shipped immediately to Chico for brewing so that they retain their peak aromatics and flavors. To ensure the freshest hops possible, we went to the added expense of flying these hops from New Zealand to Chico so we could brew with them the week after they were picked.
Amber ale with Palmetto berries and hibiscus.
Alpha, the first entry in our one-off, brewer's choice series is a Belgian-style Pale Ale at 6.2% ABV. Brewed with Pale, Carahell and Wheat malts, Amarillo and Cascade hops. This medium bodied beer is crisp on the palate with a smooth, not overly bitter hops flavor coupled with the fruity esters from the Belgian Abby yeast strain we used. Its bottle and keg conditioned, so expect a tall, fluffy head, and perhaps small amount of sediment. Just one batch was brewed in April 2008, kegs released in late May, and only 20 cases of bottles for sale only at the brewery at the special debut night event of June 13, 2008, from 5 to 8 pm. Recipe by Jeff Musselman, assistant brewer.
As for Bravo, according to Head Brewer, Chris Wilson, the base of the beer comes from pale, wheat, and crystal malts and features some roasted barley while Pilgrim and Hallertauer make up the light hop profile.

So where can you taste a Kolsch? There are no Kolsches being imported into the United States. So you could fly to Cologne. A better idea is to come to Ballast Point Brewing Company and try our Yellowtail Pale Ale Kolsch. We make it with 5% Wheat, finish hop it with Liberty and Tettnanger hops, and ferment it with a yeast we borrowed from a brewery in Cologne. So come on in and enjoy a taste of the Rhineland!!
The Calico Amber Ale was inspired by the beers of England. In England most of the beer is some kind of "bitter".  Bitter is a style that became popular in the late 1800's. The most famous examples are brewed in Burton on Trent.  This hard water gives these beer a pleasantly dry bitter finish, hence the name "bitter."  A brewery usually brews several bitters of various alcohol strengths.  The lowest in alcohol (and usually flavor) is called "bitter" or "ordinary bitter."  A step up in alcohol and hop character gives us "best bitter" or "special bitter."  Finally a beer is made that is full of hop aroma and flavor, has a maltiness to match, and a generous amount of alcohol is called an "extra special bitter" or E.S.B.

Although inspired by the British Ales  Ballast Point Calico Amber Ale uses distinctive American hops, which give not only the crisp bitterness to balance the malt, but also a hint of floral aroma. We brew Calico Amber Ale with 100% malt and use 4 different malts to give it a rich complexity.  The blend of crystal  malts give it flavors including toffee and caramel.  A blend of American Cascade and Centennial hops provide a counterpoint to the malt.  Finally our proprietary yeast provides a fruity background and a Madeira like richness that rounds out this gold medal winning ale.
Ballast Point Black Marlin Porter is a rich dark chocolaty Porter with a distinctive American hop character.  It is a great beer to go with hearty foods and is surprisingly one of the few beers that goes well with dessert. One of our favorite combinations here at Ballast Point is Black Marlin Porter with apple pie a la mode.
Ballast Point Wahoo Wheat Beer is created using the same ingredients that were once used in Belgium. Flaked unmalted wheat, oats and malted barley comprise the grain. The unmalted wheat has a high protein content, which causes the beer to be hazy, thus giving it a cloudy, or "white" appearance. A special yeast gives a refreshing tangy flavor that is different from both the sour Weiss beers of Berlin or the banana and clovey Weizens of Bavaria. The mild hopping allows the unique malts to show through and does not conflict with the subtleties of the citrus spicing. This unique citrus character is created by adding a blend of curacao (bitter orange), sweet orange and coriander to the boil. White beers are light and refreshing, yet provide a complex reminder that interesting high quality beer does not have to be bitter and dark. Ballast Point Wahoo Wheat Beer is the perfect beer for sunny San Diego.
When you make a pot of coffee, but only use half the water, you get some pretty rich coffee. That's the approach we took with our latest offering. OBP Squared, with half the water, has 11% alcohol by volume-twice that of original OBP.

The result is a bold, distinct taste of its own. Made with twice as much real orange blossom honey, all-natural ingredients and no refined sugar, it really is the new king bee of beers.
The tenacious grip of big, juicy hop aroma and character slides smoothly into rich, dark malts. This heavyweight battle between fresh, Yakima Valley hops and dark, roasted malts is resolved harmoniously as the flavors merge to deliver complex satisfaction with a warming edge. Enjoy the â€˜twilightâ€™ for the bright and brassy hops!
A pitch black stout made with ginger, cinnamon and a touch of molasses. This mediumâ€“bodied ale has flavors of dark chocolate, roasted coffee beans and ginger snap cookies.

Czech Saaz hops are added early in the boil with a late hopping using a hybrid variety we keep to ourselves, giving light flavour and a soft bitterness. Lightly kilned pilsner malt gives the beer both itâ€™s light, slightly golden colour, and leaves a crisp clean taste on the palate.
A polished, golden yellow beer with 5% alcohol. Phoenix beer is pasteurised after bottling, according to natural conservation methods. The quality of the underground water also allows us to produce a beer with no chemicals additives. Time of maturation before distribution is meticulously controlled.
Phuket Beer was created as a refreshing â€˜boutiqueâ€™ beer in view of the exotic island of Phuket with a much lower formula of bitterness than any other domestic rivals in Thailand.

Phuket Beer is the first regional beer brewed in Thailand and is positioned to appeal to both the international markets as well as the local population. This is manifested through the label and packaging designs presented in both English and Thai languages.

Phuket Beer is well positioned as a premium brand located somewhere between the local standard brands and the imported premium brands. The efforts were inspired from the feeling of being in a tropical paradise. Thai beer consumers have become more sophisticated over the years, by selecting and demanding premium and high-end beers. initial consumer target was Phuket Island's significant tourist sector, a sector that is prone to taste and drink locally produced brands.However, strategic positioning and selected marketing of Phuket Beer has resulted in a ray of successful export markets with overwhelming response from the initial markets overseas.

The philosophy is to provide a â€˜tropical lifestyleâ€™ drinking experience in a fresh clean light tasting lager beer with 5% alcohol by volume, which is in total contrast to the other Thai beers that are very bitter with higher alcohol content.
Monteithâ€™s Summer Ale is a refreshingly different beer. The opportunity to rediscover some flavour highlights of beer styles enjoyed on summer days past, and bring them back to life.

At the end of last century, in England, Europe and the Americas and in New Zealand, there was still an adherence to brew with barley, wholesome grains, hops and other traditional brewing spices.

Monteithâ€™s Summer Ale is a bright gold beer with great body from four different malts. Spiced with a single hop variety and a touch of history - a little Rata honey. Subtle, but enough to make all the difference. The result is a truly refreshing herbal spiced beer brewed for the Summer Season â€” a splendid thirst quencher.

Monteithâ€™s Summer Ale enjoyed ice-cold with a simple range of fruits, perhaps refreshing wedge of orange or lime. Alternatively, match with summer salads and stir-frys to complement the light flavours.
Monteithâ€™s Celtic Beer is considered an â€˜Irish-style aleâ€™ in the heritage of beers of a burnt-red colour traditionally brewed in the Emerald Isle.

Monteithâ€™s Celtic Beer has a dry roasted malt flavour characteristic of this style of brewing. This malty characteristic and crisp dryness is derived from malts of the roasted chocolate malt style. The hop character is medium to allow the chocolate malts to show through.

Monteithâ€™s brewers have been able to develop traditional ale fermentation characters while allowing the interesting roasted malt notes to come through in the aroma.
A traditional German-style lager, fermented at 7-9Â°C and lagered at 4Â°C for 4-6 weeks. The storage produces a soft, natural carbonation.

The story of the Seven Gates comes from rural Pennsylvania, not far from the Spring House Brewery. According to the legend, a mental asylum for the criminally insane stood in the middle of a dense forest. Surrounding the asylum were seven concentric gates, preventing would-be escapees. One terrifying night, the asylum caught fire, test link causing the inmates to flee into the menacing forest. As the tale goes, the former asylum residents were trapped by the seven gates, and eventually succumbed to the perils of the forest. The locals swear that the tormented souls of the inmates will torture anyone brave enough to attempt passage through the Seven Gates of the forest.

Spring House Brewing Co. honors the local legend by producing a terrifyingly delicious brew that is as familiar as a friendly forest, yet possesses a mysterious quality that will haunt you from the first taste. The enormous, hopped flavor and the meticulous craftsmanship that goes into each bottle will have you believing that the master brewer must be a direct descendent of the former asylum residents.

Estrella means star in Spanish and as its name suggests the brand has become a star to the people of Barcelona. It has evolved with the city reflecting its character - sophisticated and passionate yet at the same time relaxed and welcoming.
Seven varieties of malted barley are combined to give this English-style ale its complex flavor and deep, brown color. A select British yeast culture adds a subtle fruitiness and a blend of choice hops gives this non-bitter ale a soft finish.
This tribute to St. Patrick's Day is smooth and creamy, with distinctive flavors and aromas reminiscent of bitter-sweet chocolate and dark coffee. Just one precious batch of this robust, ebony colored stout is brewed each year.
Scratch #16-2008 combines the bitterness of two aroma hops, the lush sweetness of honey and malt and an earthly yeast taste creating a Winter Warmer designed to ward off the coldest days.

The dark, rich amber color comes from a combination of molasses and crystal malts; the Thames Valley brings a distinct earthly flavor; white the blend of hops creates fruity (Amarillo) and piney (Cluster) bitterness.

The Winter Warmer ends with a slight warming sensation from the elevated alcohol content.  Enjoy this one throughout the winter months.  Cheers.
Reddish brown coloring.  Aroma is slightly sweet, much like flavoring.  Very drinkable.  Recommended.
Smuttynose Winter Ale is a full-bodied, amber beer brewed with a special Trappist ale yeast. Stylistically reminiscent of a Belgian Abbey Double, it features fruity aromas and flavor, balanced by soft Crystal hops. Warming, mellow & pleasantly complex, Smuttynose Winter Ale is your perfect cold weather companion.
Our interpretation of a classic English beer style is copper-colored, medium-bodied and highly hopped. Its flavor is delightfully complex: tangy fruit at the start, with an assertive hop crispness and a long malty palate that one well-known beer writer has compared to the flavor of freshly-baked bread.
Old Brown Dog has been cited as a classic example of the â€œAmerican Brown Aleâ€ style of beer. Compared to a typical English Brown Ale, Old Brown Dog is fuller-bodied and more strongly hopped.

Old Brown Dog has been around for many years. It was first brewed in 1988 at the Northampton Brewery. In 1989 it won a silver medal in its category (American Brown Ale) at the Great American Beer Festival in Denver.
Named in honor of our hometownâ€™s 375th anniversary, Smuttynose Portsmouth Lager is a full-flavored, medium bodied continental-style beer - deep golden in color, featuring a mouth-pleasing maltiness subtly balanced with spicy imported Saaz hops. One taste of this fine lager tells you this is no ordinary beer: From its mellow, velvety body to its lingering, fresh hop finish, Portsmouth Lager is smooth, complex and satisfying.
Portsmouth is a colonial era seaport town, so it goes to follow that sooner or later we'd brew an India Pale Ale as a tribute to those big, hoppy 19th century ales that made the long sea voyage from England's temperate shores, 'round the Cape of Good Hope, to the sultry climes of the faraway East Indies.

But there's another reason we brewed this beer, one that's closer to our home and hearts. Hopheads. 

Ten years ago we brewed our first batch of Shoals Pale Ale, our American interpretation of the traditional British ESB (Extra Special Bitter) style. At the time, it was widely considered to be darned hoppy. However, a funny thing happened over the last decade - our Shoals Pale Ale didn't change; beer lovers did, and we started to hear more and more: â€œWhy don't you guys make a really hoppy beer?â€

You could say, then, that Smuttynose IPA is a physical salute to the glory of the American hop grower. The citrusy hop flavor coming from a mixture of Simcoe and Santiams is pleasantly balanced by a smooth bitterness from the Amarillo hops. The beer itself is light bodied and crisp with a golden color that will throw a slight haze, as we bottle it unfiltered. At 65 IBU's, this is definitely not a training-wheels IPA, but is meant for hop lovers looking to satisfy their craving in a way that's not easy to find. We think theyâ€™ll be quite pleased.
This hearty, mahogany colored ale is brewed to evoke the dark, full-bodied ales that were a favorite of dockworkers and warehousemen (hence the name â€œPorterâ€) in 19th century London. It is a good bet that when Dickensâ€™ Mr. Pickwick sat down for a pint, we would have been drinking an ale much like our Robust Porter.This is a smooth and very drinkable beer, characterized by its well-balanced malt and hops, plus subtle notes of coffee and chocolate.
Uranus, ruler of the heavens, reigns supreme with beauty and brilliance. Gloriously gold in color, URANUS Golden Ale holds title to our first 100% Brettanomyces fermentation and conditioning. Brewed by mere mortals and blessed by the beer gods, this ale deserves to be worshipped.

A style of Pale Ale, Black Mountain Bitter will be lightly hopped with traditional British hop varieties to balance the malt sweetness yet encourage it to tend toward the dry side. We recently received our organic certification from Clemson University after undergoing a rigid inspection and two-month compliance process. Although this represents a big step for Highland, the idea of an all organic product is consistent with our corporate ethos and embrace of natural traditional brewing methods.
"Ale to the Chief! We the Brewers of Avery Brewing Company, in order to form a more perfect ale, require new leadership that can liberate us from our quagmires in foreign lands; embrace environmentally sound energy alternatives to imported oil; heal our ailing healthcare system; free us from tyrannical debt and resurrect the collapsing dollar. We hereby pledge to provide him with an ample amount of our Presidential Pale Ale to support in the struggle for the aforementioned goals! Hail to the New Chief!" 

So reads the label of Ale to the Chief, the latest limited release brew from Avery Brewing Company brewed to bid a fond farewell to our current Commander in Chief and welcome a new administration. Our thought process for this beer was rather simple: take the classic American Pale Ale, use American ingredients like West Coast Cascade hops and the American Ale yeast strain (a first for Avery Brewing) and produce a beer in the Avery tradition with intense, in-your-face flavor. This Presidential Pale Ale has a pungent nose of citrusy, green Cascade hops along with a medium body and a lingering bitter finish. Ale to the Chief! is a limited release brew, get some while it lasts!
This German inspired wheat ale is packed full of citrus flavor. We use torrified wheat, pale, and carafoam for balance, giving it a nice hazy, straw color and refreshing wheat taste. We ferment the White Horse at higher ale temps with a German style yeast that is known for producing world class wheat beers. We let the yeast take over the majority of the flavoring in our fermenters, providing the beer with banana and clove like esters. We pull some of the yeast with it to give this brew the proper style and to keep its body and character. We than age this brew with zests of citrus and a brewers spice that blends harmoniously with the esters of the yeast and balance out the sweetness of this brew. Truly a favorite in the summer time for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.
This summertime lager is both smooth and refreshing as soon as it hits the lips. We take so much pride in it because there is truly nothing else like it on the market. We brew this American Style Lager beer with three types of malt: pilsner, pale and carafoam which enhance the head retention of this beer. We then gingerly scatter some very light floral hops at the beginning to give it some esters and sweetness that compliment the watermelon. The true magic of this beer does not occur in the brewing process but in the conditioning vessel. This is where we add the best farm fresh local watermelon and than push the beer into it, allowing it to sit and saturate for a few weeks. By the time it is complete, we are left with a unbelievably smooth tasting beer with a beautiful aroma and subtle taste of watermelon that imparts its way into this already crisp lager. Truly our customers' favorite, this one will have you reaching for another glass soon after you put the first one down.
This brew was inspired by the historical burning of our hometown of Chambersburg, PA in July 1864. During the burning, the brewery in town, "Ludwigs Brewery" operated by George Ludwig was burned to the ground by Confederate soldiers under Gen. McCausland. In remembrance of this event we created a German style rauchbier, or dark smoked lager. This beer uses all its ingredients from Bamberg, Germany, which is where the style was born and in by coincidence, the same area where Ludwig himself was born and taught to brew. It is made with a special birch wood smoked malt that imparts a light smoky aroma, taste, and dryness to the palate. The pilsner malt and noble German hops are used to balance this dryness making it very enjoyable as well as different. We believe this beer resembles how Ludwig himself might have brewed it over 100 years ago.
Our signature brew that started it all. This beer is made with four different specialty malts including two foreign caramel malts, a pale malt, and a toasted malt. These malts impart a subtle toasted/sweet taste. This malty brew is than graced with floral and aroma hops which balance the maltiness of this brew and leaves behind a smooth finish on the palate. Top notch ingredients and a truly "Honest" taste makes this a seriously drinkable ale, unlike many other bitter American ales.
This Belgian style pumpkin ale was inspired by the legendary midnight ride of Ichabod Crane. It is a Belgian style ale complimented by a light touch of pumpkin and spice. Fresh toasted pumpkins are added in the mash with the grains adding a touch of the season to the brew. The complex fruitiness and dryness of the yeast is enhanced by the addition of sugars during fermantation. The beer is lightly spiced with pumpkin spice, all spice, and brown sugar. The pale and toasted malts used, provide a pie crust taste and smell in the beer as the higher alcohol's produced round out the finish.
The one and only IPA that doesn't leave your pallet with a bitter after taste. This beer took years of practice to get down and when we finally got it right, we knew it. The beer is made with three malts in considerable additions that leave it with a more malty and sweet taste. There are five different hop additions that were carefully planed out to impart just enough bitterness to give it the body and depth that it needed without leaving you with the astringent and bitter aftertaste. We then added a plethora of English flavor and aroma hops that round out the floral and citrus esters. With the beer being so well balanced between bitter and sweet, we than added "big sacks" of bittering hops to the conditioning vessel to impart all the wonderful citrus and floral notes deep into the beer while leaving the bittering aspects of the hop behind. The result was a beer that makes you want to nose dive right in complimented by the well balanced taste of this wonderful brew.
This malty, copper-colored lager is styled after Munich's traditional "Oktoberfest" beers. A full-bodied, rich malt character is balanced by a slight bitter finish. Perfect for cooler fall days, it is lagered for five weeks. Prost!!
San Francisco's famouse Liberty Ale was first brewed on the 18th of April, 1975 to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Paul Revere's historic ride. It is virtually handmade by the brewers of Anchor Steam Beer in one of the smallest and most traditional breweries in the world. Liberty Ale is made with the finest barley malt, fresh, whole hops, top fermenting yeast, pure water and the simple natural methods which reflect our exceptional respect for the ancient art of brewing. It is "dry hopped," a classic ale tradition, and slowly completes its fermentation in sealed vats in our cellars. This unique process creates Liberty Ale's distinctive bouquet and uncommonly delicate, entirely natural carbonation.
The definitive winter beer and a longtime favourite, Winter Warmer has been making annual appearances on the bar every winter since the 1950s. A rich, ruby-coloured beer, luscious and fullbodied, with a splendid nutty flavour.

pure-malt dark ale.
rich and intense. good mix between imperial stout (but not as intense) and quadrupel. The beer has real balance and a luxurious mouthfeel


The hexagram talisman has been used around the world for centuries to invoke magic and good luck. The sixâ€“point star is also the customary symbol of the brewer, representing the essential aspects of purity: water, hops, grain, malt, yeast, and of course, the brewer. Wishes of good fortune often collaborate with the brewerâ€™s creativity to yield dramatic results. We carefully chose the name for this Imperial India Black Ale, Iniquity â€“ a word opposing goodness. Why? This beer is contrary to what one may expect from an IPA; this is an ale as black as night. It is the antithesis of Unearthly. Some may consider it an immoral act to blacken an ale. We suggest they donâ€™t rely on conventional standards. Allow the darkness to consume you. Cheers!

We started with the same grain bill as Scratch #12 (IPA) and substituted 25% rye for the base malt giving Scratch #18 a creamy mouth feel and a full-bodied taste.

Mount Hood and Chinook hops are combined here for flavoring and aroma, and Warrior hops are used for overall bitterness.

The rye plays off the Mount Hood hops, with both ingredients releasing an herbal, spicy flavor. Cheers.



There are hundreds of Trappist Monasteries in the world, many of them make fruitcake. This beer is not made by Monks nor does it resemble fruitcake. Furthermore, Truckee has no Trappist Monastery and that, my friend, is why we at FiftyFifty bring you Trifecta. This is one of FiftyFifty's seasonal ales, and is a high alcohol Belgian style beer. Brewed with inspiration from Belgian Trappist Ales, Trifecta also includes locally grown Purple Sage Honey. With a complex spiciness tempered by the sweeter notes from the sage honey, flavors of spicy sage, alcohol, and mild malt sweetness are apparent, and sage and clove like aromas predominate. Coming in at over 8%, this beer is deceptively strong.








This American-style, hop-driven beer starts with a citrus flavor, followed by two layers of caramel, and finishes on a hoppy note.

As it has aged, we've noticed flavors of dates and raisins as well.

Hefeweizen is a nice, light, crisp summer beer that can be served with lemon or flavored syrups.
Mamaâ€™s Little Yella Pils - Our upcoming new canned good is a small-batch version of the beer that made Pilsen, Czechoslovakia famous. Mamaâ€™s is made with hearty amounts of pale malt, German specialty malts, and a blend of traditional (Saaz) and 21st century Bavarian hops. Our first canned lager, itâ€™s also fermented at cool temperatures with a German yeast.

This tasteful reality Czech is the perfect antidote for the watered-down versions of pilsner clogging Americaâ€™s shelves. And Mamaâ€™s gentle hopping (about 35 IBUs) and low ABV (just 5.3%) mean weâ€™re finally honoring consumer requests for a delicious but less-challenging beer. (Hey, we like a good low-dose session beer, too.) Look for our Gold Metal Winner on US shelves in March.

Sadly, the Feds rejected our â€œTake Two and Call Us in the Morningâ€ line on the can.

Kerplunk! Imperial Chocolate Stout is named for the delicious sound made as large amounts of Wilbur chocolate and west coast hops are added directly into the simmering brew kettle.

The bold flavors found in Kerplunk! are produced using a generous blend of roasted barley, crystal malts and locally produced chocolate. The resulting brew exhibits a deliciously complex and unique profile of subtle mocha coffee and intense chocolate, balanced nicely by the underlying roasted hop bitterness. This is a balanced strong brew boasting an A.B.V. of 8.1% that can creep up on you.

A hops showcase in aroma, flavor and bitterness. We used the delightful Amarillo hop as the most prominent choice.
This dark brown porter has more bark than bite. It is actually fairly sweet and fruity with a nutty/chocolate flavor as well. Highly recommended.
Our pale ale is located toward the lighter side of the beer spectrum and we hope it will serve as a stepping stone into the more flavorful world of craft beer. Amber, caramel, fruity, hoppy and bitter.
Our lightest and palest signature brew, the Griffin is our house session beer. Notice the spicy character imparted by the German hops we use in the Griffin.

This is our flagship ale.  The label for this beer is adorned with the majestic Wapiti (aka elk).  Wapiti are abundant in northern Arizona.  They are large and beautiful creatures, which is why we chose this animal to represent this beer.  Wapiti Amber Ale is hand crafted with mountain pure water, two row malted barley, yeast and Yakima Valley hops.

Well balanced amber pale ale accentuated by multiple additions of floral Cascade hops and our unique introduction of grapefruit zest to compliment the citrus notes of the hops.
We drew inspiration from Steveâ€™s Grandmotherâ€™s holiday biscotti recipe to create this one of a kind brew. By utilizing an array of malts, oats, wheat, pure local honey, light European hops and delicately spicing with Grains of Paradise, Madagascar vanilla beans, whole star anise, all brought together with traditional Belgian yeast, the result is a cloudy, deep copper colored, complex experience. This delight to the senses should be served in a 12 ounce footed glass and allowed to warm to 50 degrees to fully gather the malt and spice spectrum.

Kielbasi! 

Cheeses? 
Try it with Gouda, Brie, Swiss, or Havarti.
Malty and yeasty, with some sweetness along with hints of cloves and banana. (thanks to the yeast!) 

Low hop bitterness, highly carbonated. Unfiltered, and so a bit cloudy with that magical yeast. 

Pairs well with Thai, Szechuan, Mexican, and Caribbean -- und Deutsche Nahrung! (German Food!)
Brewed with real mashed Long Island Potatoes (or is it "Potatos"?) in the mash - hence, "twice mashed." 

I'll admit, my Polish, Irish, and German heritage finds the siren song of potatoes irresistible. (My French blood, not so much.) The local, Long Island agriculture booster in me needs to go for the Long Island potato above all others. 

With a brewery this small (basically a home brewery with a license to sell), I can brew what "gets" me, with hopes that some folks will enjoy it.
A smoked wit, you say? 
Yup. 

Researching smoked beers led me to a world of smoked wheat beers, particularly a smoked wheat beer popular in Poland about 100 years ago. (I'll list that one as one of the Blind Bat beers when I'm happy with the test batches and am ready to offer it to the public.) I didn't find anything about smoked wit beers, but decided to experiment a bit (a wit is a wheat beer). I like it, and hope you will too. 

Pictured on the label is Long Island's old Walt Whitman, enjoying a smoke and a book in what is purported to be his favorite spot in his native West Hills. Long Island's springtime is awakening all around him.
Sometimes it's good to keep it simple. 

Harborfields HefeWeizen is modeled after the German classic, but meant to be available fresh (like you would enjoy if you were in Germany). Shipping over long distances is not always a friend to beer. 

Named for the Centerport-Greenlawn area of Long Island that is home to the Blind Bat Brewery, Harborfields Hefeweizen goes great with fish, chicken, or a summer salad. Some even like it with brunch! (Please enjoy your waffles responsibly.)
Samuel Adams Imperial Stout is our take on the stouts brewed by 18th century English brewers for the Russian Imperial Court of Catherine II. The special malted barley in this intense and massive brew delivers rich flavours like dark chocolate, coffee and anise.
Samuel Adams® Imperial White is a new perspective on the classic witbier style.  Witbiers are normally light and refreshing with a fruity finish and we wanted to see how these characteristics would stand up when we amped up the recipe.  We were totally blown away by the flavors that were created by this beer.

This is not just a more intense version of our spring seasonal Samuel Adams® White Ale.  Imperial White is a new recipe that stands on it own merits.  In fact, it is more of a wine substitute than just another refreshing witbier.  This is a beer that should be sipped and savored and you
Our Czech style pilsner is all malt all the time-no choicest rice or corn syrup here! Whole flower Czech Saaz hops balance the delicate honey flavor of our organic Canadian grown pilsner malt creating a golden beer with depth of character.
Our namesake IPA is a Northwest classic. Generous additions of Amarillo, Centennial, and Ahtanum hops find their way into the kettle, hop-back, and dry-hop. This judicious use of the "brewers spice" creates rich and resinous flavors of citrus fruit and pine. The finest organic Canadian pilsner malt and organic German Munich and Caramunich malts then bring balance to your new favorite beer.
This English Session Beer has a delicious floral hop aroma and flavor. A heaping helping of organic caramel malt and touch of organic chocolate malt give this beer its beautiful mahogany color while organic oats from Bob's Red Mill velvetize the texture. Smoother than an infomertial host at half the price!
This beer bridges east and west with a lane dedicated to riders who aren't afraid to get dirty. Three kinds of organic caramel malts and a 24 pound whirlpool hop bomb keep things interesting while the wheels go round and round. Cheers to narrow knobbies, kazoos, and more cowbell!
"Strong like bull but sweet like your momma. This unique beer is a trifecta of bold flavors. Hops, malt and alcohol bully the taste buds on the organic playground while the monitor blows the whistle!"
Beer of the Ancients! Barley (Egyptian), Wheat (Mesopotamian), Oats (Egyptian), Amaranth (Aztec), Quinoa (Incan), Spelt (Mesopotamian), and Kamut (Egyptian) sustain the soul with a nutrients cultivated through the millennia. Finished with 15 pounds of cold-pressed Stumptown Hairbender espresso. Unlock the mystery entombed in darkness.
Here at Left Coast Brewing Co. we pride ourselves on being one of the first breweries to pioneer a Double IPA style beer. In 2003, we brewed our first Double IPA, and haven't looked back since. This hop monster uses Premium American 2- Row and a touch of light crystal malt to create a solid malt foundation. The recipe calls for hops to be used in every step of the brewing process; in the mash, in a hop back, in the fermenter, and in the bright tanks. We use hop extract, hop pellets and hop flowers, hence the name Hop Juice. Hop Juice spends more than 4 weeks dry hopping in the fermenter and the bright beer tank. It is approximately 9.4% abv and has massive IBUs. Hop usage is over 4lbs per barrel. Hopeheads, step up to the plate!
Our award-winning India Pale Ale  is a hop loverâ€™s dream. We use Galena and Cascade hops in the kettle and dry-hop with more cascade during conditioning. This copper-colored ale has a nice maltiness to balance all the hops.
This is one of our most popular beers. It is a light and refreshing raspberry-flavored wheat ale.  We use pure raspberry extract to give this beer its fruity aroma and flavor.
We put close to a half a pound of Colorado honey per case in this wheat ale. The honey adds a sweetness and raises the alcohol content slightly. We use Mount hood and hallertau hops.
Porters are dark ales without the roasted malt character of a stout. Our porter is a brown porter with a very smooth, balanced profile.
This is our smooth golden ale. Our Gold has a medium body and low to medium hop bitterness 
and aroma.
Our commemorative ale honors Samson the elk. This is an oatmeal stout that is full-bodied with a wonderful roasted flavor and just a touch of sweetness.
Our red is a special bitter. This means it has medium body and mild bitterness. These balance well with the rich copper color. We use American hops.
According to legend, gold panned from the crystal clear Border streams of the Yarrow valley, nearby the site of the Broughton Ales brewery, was used to make the third wedding ring of Mary Queen of Scots.
 
This golden coloured ale is brewed with a skilful blend of organically grown hops and malt, and pure Scottish water to the exacting standards required by Soil Association Certification Ltd. of the United Kingdom.

The end result is a light golden coloured, clean tasting beer with an excellent hop aroma and aftertaste.

At 6.0% ABV a premium ale for those who know and care about what they eat and drink.

Border Gold has won several awards, the most recent being a bronze medal in the International Brewing Awards in Munich 2005.
This strong alluring ale is two beers in one. Cracking open a fresh bottle unleashes hops and heat with more than 100 IBUs emanating from three hop varieties and sweet burn of 9.3% ABV. Cellaring the Flying Mouflan in a cool dark place at 50 degrees for a minimum of four months will mellow out the hops and wash away the heat. If you can resist temptation you will be rewarded with two memorable beers in a single bottle.
Modeled after the classic wheat beers of Bavaria, our HefeWeizen has a cloudy, straw-colored appearance with a thick, creamy head.

A delicious example of the "neo-classical" American beer style. It has a beautiful copper color and is topped with a thick rich head. With a hint of ale fruitiness in the nose, Pale Ale starts out malty, finishes dry and has plenty of Cascade hops in between. It is sure to satisfy the most discerning ale aficionados.
A fall classic, our Oaktoberfest emphasizes rich malt flavor. We use German malt and hops to give it an authentic Bavarian character.

Available September - December
With about 6.0% ABV, this one will surely warm the ol' gullet during a cold central Texas winter - both days! Our India Pale Ale (IPA) is light in color and strong in hop character. Dry hopping with Cascade hops, gives this winter favorite a delicious citrus note reminiscent of a Texas Ruby Red. Yes, it's warming but you don't need to be huddled around the furnace to enjoy this one! IPA fans really love this ale during a beautiful Texas winter on the porch or indoors. Available December - April

"Black, dense, and rich, this is a great ale for the cellar." This big brew is made with molasses and brewer's licorice.
A massively hopped Imperial IPA brewed to celebrate Valley Brews 10th anniversary. 1 pound of hops were added every 10 minutes during a 100 minute boil, a total of 10 different boiling hops. 4 different fresh hops were used in the hopback and then the beer was passed through a chamber containing 10 lbs of fresh hops on the way from the serving tanks to the bar taps. Hopperiffic.

coffee finish.

Double-Wide I.P.A. uses Zeus and Magnum hops for both bittering and aroma, with Ahtanum hops added solely for aroma. Two additional dry hopping regimens employ Ahtanum, Centennial, and Chinook varietals. The resulting beer â€“ not surprisingly â€“ has a hop forward aroma, redolent of peach and apricot. The assertive flavor bursts forth with citrus notes of blood orange and lemon, a caramel malt backbone serves to balance the intensity of the hops. There is little restraint in the flavor of this beer; it is certainly not for the pedestrian palate.
The latest addition to the Boulevard family of year-around beers, Single-Wide I.P.A. is our take on a style that originated in 18th century Great Britain. This American version -- inspired by our Smokestack Series Double-Wide I.P.A. -- boasts a heady combination of six varieties of hops, some of which were employed for dry-hopping.

First introduced in 2008, Boulevard Maibock is a new, limited-release seasonal brew. A welcome sign of Spring, this beer is a traditional German lager, lighter in color than other bocks. Boulevardâ€™s Maibock is a distinctive, refreshing take on this springtime classic.
Boulevardâ€™s summer seasonal is our interpretation of a classic Belgian witbier. ZÅŒN (Flemish for â€œsunâ€) combines the subtle flavors of coriander and orange peel with other traditional ingredients to create a delightful, refreshing summertime brew. Available from May through August, in bottles and draught.
Boulevardâ€™s fall seasonal beer, Bobâ€™s â€™47 Oktoberfest is a medium-bodied, dark amber brew with a malty flavor and well-balanced hop character.

The simplicity of Hoppe tests the skill and ability of the brewer to create something truly majestic. We craft this much like a sculptor who uses only a hammer and chisel to shape stone into a masterpiece. Hoppe is spawned of these few essentials: barley, wheat, hops, yeast and water. This limited palette is an exercise in minimalism, with refined elements which are deliberately selected. This simple combination creates a golden shimmering brew infused with delicate aromas. The artful nature of this beer is exposed with the first taste. As the malt and hops create a composition of flavors, an elegant finish leaves an impression that your tastes will not soon forget.
High in the winter sky, two parallel stick figures are visible & known as â€œthe twins,â€ or the constellation Gemini. The astronauts of the 1960s flew as teams of two in a program named after the celestial pairing. At Southern Tier, we have our own fraternal twins, Hoppe & Unearthly. Blended together & placed in this vessel, the mission of our Gemini is to travel high & take passengers on a journey far into the heavens.
Our IPA has lots of malt and hop character.  This style originated during Queen Victoriaâ€™s reign as a strong, flavorful ale, which was able to survive the ocean voyage from England to India during the British occupation.
The Burning Bird is our representation of the Phoenix, our cityâ€™s namesake, a mythical bird which lived 500 years, consumed itself by fire, then was reborn from its ashes. Like the phoenix of old, this pale ale is reborn from the time when fabulous hoppy brews were more than mere myths.


Abbey ale with hints of bubble gum flavor.

Certain things seem interminable. The line at the DMV. The commencement address. Winter. 

But take heart. Even the longest, darkest winter gives way to spring and a new sense of optimism that the best is just ahead. That thoughtâ€”and an itchy wool robeâ€”sustained the monks through times of fasting. Their reward? A bock beer with the power to rejuvenate the body and the soul. That, and the opportunity to exchange the wool robe for a nice burlap one. 

So when youâ€™re stuck in the middle of that seemingly endless glass of mediocre beer, be optimistic. A Dundee Pale Bock awaits.

A traditional German Maibock with a deep, golden color, malty-sweet aroma, and clean finish from Magnum and Czech Saaz hops.
More and more weâ€™re becoming a nation of milquetoasts. And nowhere is that more evident than in our beerâ€”puny liquids without calories, carbs, or cojones. 

But it neednâ€™t be that way, my friend! Sure, we donâ€™t want to make a living shoveling coal or washing clothes on a rock. But we can recapture the more robust spirit of a time gone by.

Dundee Porter is a throwback to a different eraâ€”when times were tough and so were the people. They drank big beers, slapped each other on the back, and toasted the good lifeâ€”even though they only saw it from a distance. 

With Dundee Porter, you can get a taste of it.

Big and malty flavor from aromatic dark-roasted grains balanced by a subtle hint of hops. Deep color and rich caramel flavor.
Senator Joseph McCarthy. The Hollow Earth Society. Members of the Spanish Inquisition. All convinced they were blessed with the gift of clarity. And proof that clarity might be overrated. 

Sometimes, being unclearâ€”and a little flexibleâ€”is a good thing. Like when you are looking for the perfect refreshment. Dundee Wheat Beer combines wheat and yeast into a refreshing hefeweizen-style brew. Unfiltered, so it is slightly cloudy and pleasantly unclear. 

So the next time youâ€™re convinced youâ€™re right about what youâ€™ve been drinking, give a little â€œunclarityâ€ a try.

An American-style, unfiltered wheat beer. Pale straw in color with a light cloudiness from carefully selected wheat and yeast. Pleasant spicy malt aroma and a crisp hop finish.
Behold the hop. A flower, but too unsightly to be used for decoration. The ugly duckling of the flower family. 

Oh, but the secret it holds. Soak it in some water with the right companions and it surrenders its bouquet to use a corny flower metaphor. That unique hop flavor is the difference between a fine pale ale and more ordinary beers. 

Dundee Pale Ale understands the secret of the hop flowerâ€”the power to turn an ordinary beer into something extraordinary. 

And the power to make you indescribably hoppy. 

A wonderfully balanced true pale ale. Cascade, Tomahawk, and Amarillo hops create a citrusy aroma with a smooth, crisp finish. A subdued malt character nicely complements the hop complexity and produces an orangey amber hue.
It takes a bit of seasoning to understand that bitter can be a good thing. 

When youâ€™re a child, you want everything to be sweet. When youâ€™re a teenager, you want everything to be sweeeeet. But when you get a bit wiser and acquire some taste, you realize that bitter is an excellent alternative. Itâ€™s a sign of complexity. Itâ€™s a sign of maturity. Itâ€™s a sign of the times. Face it, modern life demands a little bitterness every once in a while. 

When you are in the mood for something bitter, Dundee IPA is hop bitterness at its finest. As the youngsters would say, thatâ€™s sweet.

An aggressively hopped IPA brewed with Amarillo and Simcoe hops. Blended Crystal malts balance the flavors with a distinctive spicy aroma and a long, crisp finish.
So did you ever ask yourself...what exactly is there to be festive about during the holidays? Your brother in-law snoring on the air mattress? (Boy, letâ€™s hope thatâ€™s snoring.) The variety of toys with realistic sound effects? Fruit cake?

Dundee Festive Ale may be one of the few exceptions. One sip of the carefully matched seasonal spices and you realize that the holidays are worth paying...waiting for.

Oh, there may be one other thing to be festive about. Thereâ€™s a 13 to 1 chance against your brother in-lawâ€™s plane leaving on time. But at least thereâ€™s a chance.

Festively hearty and full bodied with a mild nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon, and orange peel spice character and subtle crystal malt flavor.
If malt and hops are the two poles of brewing, this beer is the gently spinning sweet spot between them. First, youâ€™ll notice the spicy aromas of Perle and Hallertau hops. Then - wipe the foam off the tip of your nose - dive into the toasty flavors of Vienna and Munich malts. Dynamo starts strong and finishes crisp and smooth. The balanced flavors, aromas, and even the coppery-red tones of this beer go great with everything. Fear no pairing. The best time to enjoy Dynamo is when youâ€™re thirsty.

Dynamo Copper Lager goes great with pizza, neighborhood block parties, spring rolls, first dates, football games, whiskey, tapas, the Sunday newspaper, late-night burritos, veggie omelets, business lunches, grilled mushrooms, pretzels, political debate, corn-on-the-cob, classic sci-fi flicks, mixed greens, campfires, salmon, billiards, cherry pie, rock shows, pumpernickel, salsa, grand openings, peanuts, sewing bees, extra sharp cheddar cheese, and holidays.
The kinetic beauty of spicy hops grabs you by the nose and lets you know: this is German-inspired beer. A mild, bready malt sweetness greets you at the lips, smoothing the crisp hop flavors. Flywheel is meant for bombastic celebrations of singing voices and clamoring mugs. But then, that first contented moment of happy hour is uniquely celebratory as well.

Flywheel Bright Lager goes great with hot dogs, guitar jams, stir fry, bowling, taco salad, house warmings, baked potatoes, Saturday morning cartoons, tequila, gouda cheese, karaoke, bagel & schmear, Euchre, fresh berries, asparagus, 16-inch softball, sushi, darts, Pad Thai, family reunions, pb&j, flan, romantic weekend getaways, garlic bread, pay raises, nachos, baby showers, fondue, and Frisbee golf.

A well balanced, full flavored, amber ale. It has a rich, malty body with a pleasant caramel character derived from a specialty Caravienne malt. A complex hop aroma, with a hint of floral and citrus comes from a combination of Cascades and Liberty hops. It has a rich, creamy head with a fine lace. The light fruitiness, characteristic of ales, is derived from a proprietary yeast strain. 

Saint Arnold Amber Ale is best consumed at 50 - 55Â° Fahrenheit.
A traditional India Pale Ale, the Elissa IPA is very hoppy with a properly balanced malty body. Elissa has huge hop additions in the kettle that give it a wonderful bitterness and is then dry-hopped in the fermenter to create the pleasant floral, hoppy nose. Our reverse osmosis water makes the bitter very soft with no harsh notes to it. The maltiness is derived from British Maris Otter malt. Its rich flavor stands up to the hops that would otherwise dominate this beer. The Elissa is an authentic version of an India Pale Ale (IPA) style.
An authentic, German-style Bock, celebrating the coming of spring. This strong, deeply flavored lager has been aged to create a smooth, malty taste with a hint of sweetness. A light addition of German hops balances the malt flavor.

Our Gran Met (Grand Master) is an Ale made from our Propriatery yeast from a small brewery in Belgium. We use Cane and Beet sugar, along with German Pilsner Malt to create the unique flavor of this age old style.

This process allows for a more clean, tight flavor profile.10% alc by vol.

When you bring a glass of this dark copper ale to your lips to take your first sip you will notice the aroma of cinnamon.  There is no aromatic hop added that might overpower the distinct spice scent.  The medium body of this beer is formed from caramel and pale malts.

Brooklyn Black Ops does not exist. However, if it did exist, it would be a robust stout concocted by the Brooklyn brewing team under cover of secrecy and hidden from everyone else at the brewery.

They say there are only 1,000 cases. We have no idea what theyâ€™re talking about.
ESB was launched into the Fuller's family in 1971, as a winter brew to replace a beer named Old Burton Extra. The potential of the beer was soon realised and ESB was installed as a permanent fixture, creating an immediate impact. 

Not only was it one of the strongest regularly brewed draught beers in the country (at 5.5% ABV), it was also one of the tastiest, and as the awareness of the beer grew, so did its popularity. ESB's reputation was soon enhanced after being named CAMRA's (Campaign for Real Ale) Beer of the Year in 1978, and the beer has not stopped winning since! 

With three CAMRA Beer of the Year awards, two World Champion Beer awards, and numerous other gold medals to speak of, ESB is, quite simply, the Champion Ale.

This is a beer of subtlety and complexity, with malted rye, spicy, fruity yeast notes, biscuit-like malt backbone, and a slight citrus hop character. With age, this beer will dry out and will become more complex with rustic notes of leather and earth from the contribution of a wild yeast strain. Being a Saison, Saison Rue is ambiguous unto itself as it is a different beer when fresh and when aged. We hope you enjoy it in all of its incarnations.
Our Spring Saison is light blonde in color with a fresh hoppiness and a wild and rustic Brettanomyces character. Lighter in color and alcohol than our Saison Rue, yet equally complex in its own way. Perfect for warmer weather and Spring celebrations.
Our Summer seasonal, Trade Winds Tripel is a Belgian-style Golden Ale with a Southeast Asian twist. Instead of using candi sugar (typical for such a beer), we use rice in the mash to lighten the body and increase the gravity, and spice with Thai Basil. The result is an aromatic, digestible and complex beer made for a lazy summer evening.
Brewed with 17 lbs. of yams per barrel (in other words, a lot of yams!), this autumn seasonal is a different take on the â€œpumpkinâ€ beer style. Brewed with cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, vanilla, molasses, and maple syrup, and fermented with our traditional Belgian yeast strain, this bold and spicy beer is perfect on a cold autumn evening.
Our holiday beer is a Belgian-style Dark Strong Ale, brewed with our brewery-made dark candi sugar, Munich and Vienna malts. Dark brown in color, fruity and complex with a rich malt backbone. This is a simple yet immensely complex beer meant to be savored and shared with friends and family.
Every beer tells a story, and some are longer than others.

Consider Scratch #19; originally designed as an enhanced take on Scratch #15 with a slightly higher ABV, our brewers went to town to deliver a brew slightly more akin to our fabled Scratch #5, the Imperial Oatmeal Stout brewed for The Flying Mouflan Experience.

For Scratch #19, we teamed up with St. Thomas Roasters of Linglestown to create a special blend of espresso beans. They added Kenyan beans to the mix because of a strong citrus flavor that compliments the hops. Creating en environment akin a French press, the beans are combined with whole flower hops in the hopback, and the hot wort passes through the vessel on the way to fermentation giving Scratch #19 a lush coffee espresso nose and hints of coffee flavor. There is a silky quality to the mouthfeel and a citrus hop finsh coming from the Kenyan beans and hops.

Some stories have twists, and unfortunately a faulty valve in the fermentation cellar led to a dramatic beer tragedy one afternoon in the brewery. Risking life and limb (while keeping his mouth open to sample the beer), a heroic brewery team member took the dive reconnecting the valve and saving about half the batch of Scratch #19.

So for your amusement (and our final relief), we give you a draft-only release of a third-take on a style that demands continued research for the Troegs Brewery staff. Enjoy!
The first offering from the Coastal Extreme Brewing Company blends some of the world's finest ingredients into a delightful beer. In producing our amber ale, we selected the highest quality European and American malts and hops. This ale has a malt character which is delicately balanced with its hop profile so that consumers of all levels enjoy drinking it. Hurricane Amber Ale is a full flavored beer which clearly has more taste than other domestic and imported light beers while at the same time does not overpower the drinker with heavy body or excessive bitterness. So find yourself a cold 'Hurricane' and ENJOY!
Whilst we wouldnâ€™t recommend having this at breakfast with your bacon and eggs, our Coffee Beer is made with real coffee and has a caffeine hit to match. The natural flavours of the beans selected and hand roasted by our friends at the Union Coffee Roasters go well with the roast barley in the beer to give a silky-smooth drink with distinct chocolate and vanilla notes. 

Our first formulation of this beer was the first UK brewed beer to carry the Fairtrade logo, and, although we have reformulated it to create an even better blend of malt and roast coffee flavours, we can no longer get enough coffee in each bottle to qualify for Fairtrade status. However we are still using the same Faitrade Araba Bourbon beans from Rwandaâ€™s Abuhuzamugambi Bakawa Co-operative.

At the Meantime Brewing Co we love flavour, so it wasnâ€™t exactly difficult for us to see how the scents and aromas of coffee and barley would create a perfect match like just like mint and lamb, toffee and banana, peaches and cream, peanut butter and jam. Serve lightly chilled with as many chocolate truffles as your conscience allows.

Each serving is equal to one cup of coffee



This Ale is Brewed in Honor of the 40th Anniversary Release of this Album.
ur Old Faithful Ale is a Pale Golden Ale with a crisp body and light malt sweetness. We cold condition this ale to give it a pleasantly smooth character and dry palate. The Willamette and imported UK Goldings hops give this beer a light floral hop aroma, making it exceptionally easy to drink.
This brew is a favorite for those who love hops! This medium copper-colored ale is dry hopped for a strong hop nose with medium malt overtones and hint of caramel that blend for one great tasting beer!
Our Lager (Dortmund-style) is brewed with pale, Munich and Vienna malts and is moderately hopped with Hallertauer hops. Dortmund is an industrial, steel-making town and its lagers are hearty, easy drinking brewskies. The hops balance the malt but not overtly so. A great brew for the end of a hard day at work. Winner of the Gold Medal for Best European Style Pilsner at the 2000 Great American Beer Festival , Gold Medal at the 5th and 6th Great International Beer Festival, Silver Medals at the 7th Great International Beer Festival and 9th Great International Beer Festival, and Bronze Medal at the 8th Great International Beer Festival and 11th Great International Beer Festival!


Ladies and Gentlemen, Shmaltz Brewing Co. is proud to introduce Bittersweet Lenny's R.I.P.A. Brewed with an obscene amount of malts and hops. Shocking flavors - far beyond contemporary community standards. We cooked up the straight dope for the growing minions of our nation's Radical Beer junkies. Judges may not be able to define "Radical Beer," but you'll damn well know it when you taste it. Bruce died, officially declared a pauper by the State of California, personally broken and financially bankrupt simply for challenging America's moral hypocrisies with words. The memorial playbill read: "Yes, we killed him. Because he picked on the wrong god." -Directed by, the Courts, the Cops, the Church... and his own self-destructive super ego. Like Noah lying naked and loaded in his tent after the apocalyptic deluge: a witness, a patron saint, a father of what was to come. Sick, Dirty, Prophetic Lenny: a scapegoat, a martyr, a supreme inspiration.



What do brewmasters do in their free time? If you're Phil Markowski, the obsesseive brewmaster of Southampton, you brew at home, of course! Phil turned his fascination with Belgian-style white ales into a quest to master one of the most challenging beers to brew. Using rustic ingredients like un-malted wheat, Phil experimented over his stove until he felt it was perfect. Take one taste and you'll agree, Phil got it "white."
Somewhat of a cousin to Barleywine, Big Dickâ€™s is a classic English-style Olde Ale.  Sweet and full-bodied malt flavors are complemented by a fragrant but mild hop bitterness.  Sweet, bready malt aromas combine with rich flavors of dark fruit, brown sugar, caramel, and sweet nuts. A beer for keeping, Big Dickâ€™s Olde Ale will age gracefully, while fruity flavors continue to develop and bitterness will subside.

This is not only a BIG beer, it is a Well-Endowed Ale!  We took a traditional English-style Ale and made it our own.  Delightful on its own or as a digestif with a full-bodied cigar, Big Dickâ€™s is also big enough to stand up to many boldly-flavored foods.
This hophead's delight contains 7 hop additions. A malt background balances the hoppy bitterness for a complex flavor.
An easy drinking ale that goes well with our food offerings.  Also a great introduction to the world of craft brewing.
Original Dark Lager is brewed according to J.C. Jacobsen's original recipe. The colour is chestnut. It has a Hersbrucker hiop aroma while the floor malted Munich malt adds a caramel character. The carbonisation is gentle and the hop bitterness is soft. Enjoy at 6-8C.
A dark rich full-bodied stout with a dense creamy head.  Full of character and very satisfying.
A smooth golden ale flavored with Pilsner malt and fresh local honey from Schaefer Shack Farms.
A clean crisp ale with a beautiful reddish caramel color and a superb balance of hops and malts.
A mild pleasant ale with lingering hoppy notes.
A Baltic Porter made to celebrate Boulder's 150th anniversary. Available for the entirety of 2009.
A favorite of many coffee-loving beer drinkers, Big Shot Espresso Stout boasts about a shot of espresso in every pint. Twisted Pine teamed up with popular Amante Coffee in Boulder to produce what Amante co-owner and founder Greg Buchheister calls "the most perfectly balanced buzz." The earthy, dark chocolate flavors of the Amante Espresso blend to the flawless balance of the beer.

A well balanced American Amber Ale. Smooth malt character balanced with a healthy dose of Cascade hops aged on oak chips - our most popular beer.
A light bodied golden ale, low in hop character with a spicy aroma from whole Czech Saaz hops.
One of these beers is available all of the time. Our heartiest beers emphasize roasted malts and the generous use of hops. Creamy, smooth and always nitrogenated, these beers are nearly a meal or a dessert in themselves.
The slightly roasted flavor and nutty palate with a hint of hops make this beer subtle and drinkable.
This is a classic American Porter, poured on tap it has a good head that stays and leaves a nice lace.  It is defined by its chocolate malt, medium body, and smooth mouthfeel.  Balanced by the Golding and Columbus hops on the finish is a hint of bitterness.  
Donâ€™t be afraid of the dark.
Anything but a typical American Pale, Santa Fe Pale Ale is as full bodied as its most robust English counterparts, while asserting its American origin with a healthy nose resplendent with Cascade and Willamette hops. It finishes with a well-balanced combination of the subtle, almost Pilsner-like maltiness accentuated by the German yeast used to brew this Santa Fe classic, and a hop bite sufficient to leave a lingering smile on the face of any fan of American Pale Ales.
A true Bavarian wheat yeast, sixty percent wheat malt, and German hops make Santa Fe Wheat Beer as true to the style as any American rendition can be. German Wheat Beer, with its hints of banana and clove, its delectable, spicy, hops, and its pale golden color, is becoming increasingly popular in Americaâ€™s craft brewing world, and with good reason: wheat beers are both light enough to please light beer drinkers, and complex enough to please true micro-brew connoisseurs. To mimic a classic German Hefeweisen, after pouring your Santa Fe Wheat Beer into a glass, swirl the last few drops in the bottle to loosen the yeast from the bottom, then pour the yeast over the top of your beer.
The Brown Ale style originated in the pubs of England, where beer drinkers desired a beer that was both flavorful and complex, but at the same time mild enough to be a session beer. The Santa Fe Brewing Company's interpretation of this style uses a combination of high mash temperature, hard water, and low-alpha acid hops to produce a product that is both true to the style and distinctly Santa Fe. Brewing jargon aside, Santa Fe Nut Brown Ale is an easy-drinking beer, mild, smooth, and always a favorite. Try a keg at your next party!
A trademark beer of the Santa Fe Brewing Companyâ€™s master brewer, Ty Levis, the State Pen Porter has every reason to be one of his favorites. It is flavorful, swimming with notes of nuts and chocolate; it is drinkable, so drinkable that it is almost as if pint after pint were drinking itself.
A hearty sip of the Santa Fe Stout delights oneâ€™s taste buds first with a generous Irish serving of roast malt that rolls off the tongue with a creamy bitterness reminiscent of the finest coffee. Supported by the complex, yet light body only possible with a good Irish yeast strain, this coffee-like creaminess eventually yields to the warmth of a subtle variety of hops, and their mild, full flavor. A favorite with regular customers, this rare brew can occasionally be found on draft at restaurants in Santa Fe, but is more likely on tap at the Brewery's tasting room. Despite its intimidating dark color, this brew has an uncanny ability to convert those who claim not to like beer. The balance of flavors and complexity of aroma are recognized and appreciated by all who taste this fine brew.
Chicken Killer Barley Wine is the revolutionary beer that will someday define America's unique Barley Wine style. It is brewed with twice the ingredients of the Santa Fe Brewing Company's other beers, and only half the usual amount of liquid is extracted from these ingredients. This makes one substantial beer. At over ten percent alcohol, Chicken Killer is actually as substantial as wine, but this is not to say that it is difficult to drink. On the contrary; be careful with this one. The flavors of the beer are at first as overwhelming as the intense Santa Fe sun. But in the same way our sun gives us the unrivaled brilliant colors of Santa Fe, the potency of Chicken Killer gives us the remarkable spectrum of flavors that can be found in no other beer, in no other city. If you did not have the opportunity to try last year's vintage, come try this year's!
A classic beer for those beer lovers who love their hops, Fiesta IPA will take the Pepsi Challenge (or IPA challenge, as we say in New Mexico) against any other pretenders to the throne. Was it divine providence that made this beer the king of the IPA world? Was it a tireless pursuit of glory? No, this IPA has a top-secret recipe to thank for its success, and this meticulously formulated combination of several different hops combined with a very specific brewing process give Fiesta IPA a spicy, citric, and floral infusion of hop character, which is masterfully counterbalanced with the full-bodied maltiness characteristic of the Santa Fe Brewing Companyâ€™s distinctive beers.
As its name suggests, this Pilsner does not like to be categorized. Inquiring whether it is a German, Czech, Bavarian, American, or any other style pilsner will result in an impatient sigh and the explanation that the whole philosophy behind this pilsner is that it does not fall into any categories. True, it is brewed with traditional ingredients (soft water, pilsner malt, saaz hops, and German yeast), but it is the way that these ingredients interact, and the characteristics of the yeast, that cause this particular pilsner to defiantly stand alone. The assertively hopped Freestyle pils exudes the flavor and the aroma of the classic Saaz hop (a tribute to â€œthe originalâ€ pilsner), while maintaining enough body to balance but not overpower this hopâ€™s pleasant, spicy tone. An unhurried lagering process so frequently overlooked by American craft brewers is strictly adhered to in the production of Freestyle, which makes this beer by far the most light, clean, and quenching beer in the Santa Fe Brewing Companyâ€™s line up.
Viszolay is a distinctly continental ale with a hint of the southwest. Belgian malt, Bavarian and Czech hops, and a secret blend of German and Belgian yeast strains provide this beer, inspired by the Trappistâ€™s Dubbel style ale, with a strong traditional base, while a hint of New Mexico wildflower honey infuses it with that ethereal quality that we New Mexicans simply call, â€œenchantingâ€. Like the Trappist ales from which it sprung, Viszolay is light and refreshing. The hopâ€™s subtle notes are overpowered by complex fruity flavors derived from the Belgian yeast, leaving Viszolay a very drinkable (yet rather potent) addition to the Santa Fe Brewing Companyâ€™s family of beers.
This wonderfully refreshing beer specialty from Stiegl, Austriaâ€™s largest privately owned brewery is brewed in strict adherence with the 1516 purity law of only using water, malt and hops. Stiegl-GoldbrÃ¤u is an Austrian styled beer with its own distinctive Salzburg lager flavor. The 12o original gravity is unparalleled in its even taste and ability to refresh. It is mildly hopped is golden in color has a great head with a superb finish. Stiegl-GoldbrÃ¤u is considered by many connoisseurs to be the worldâ€™s finest beer.
Stiegl Weizengold. It has 12o original gravity; the choicest ingredients and a top fermentation process are responsible for the highest possible quality and an unmistakable flavor. It is brewed according to the classic wheat beer recipe: 60 % wheat malt and 40 % barley malt, top fermentation and in compliance with the Purity Law of 1516.  This dark wheat beer specialty is a natural and spicy beer brand.
This is a light beer with a full taste and a third less alcohol so therefore 30% less calories. It is ideal for beer lovers who prefer light beers but do not want to renounce the taste.
Paracelsus Zwickl is a natural beer specialty with a mellow impression on the tongue. The aftertaste unfolds a slight bitterness. Zwickl-beer is not filtered and therefore shows some cloudiness due to rests of yeast, minerals and trace elements.

This very special beer is brewing at its best using a sophisticated recipe combined with love and dedication. Stiegl only uses excellent ingredients from Austrian agricultural suppliers, applying biological techniques. As a result of this Paracelsus Zwickl beer was awarded the Bio-Austria certificate. Bio-production is subject to strict yearly controls by â€œAustria-Bio-Guarantyâ€.

â€œBier is a really divine medicineâ€. This quotation comes from Paracelsus (1493 â€“ 1541). He was a well known physician, forward thinker and visionary who lived in Salzburg for many years. He found out that beer had healing powers.

To mark the 250 year anniversary of the signing of the lease on St. Jame's Gate Brewery by Arthur Guinness, we introduce a special commemorative stout. This premium recipe provides a refreshing taste, which underlies the complex flavor of stout.

SPECIAL COMMEMORATIVE BEER

Former brewer Ken Pajak teamed up with MSBC to create a very special beer to celebrate the 10 years that he and wife Shauna have owned CafÃ© Amsterdam. Since taking over this mid-town establishment, the Pajaks added a â€œbeer & wine licenseâ€ and subsequently transformed the European-style cafÃ© into a beer-centric place to grab breakfast, lunch, dinner and all beers during, around and between these fabulous meals. 

The cafe's beer menu is extensive and all-encompassing. The staff is knowledgeable and enthusiastic. And the beer pour is always rightâ€” temperature, glass, presentation. 

â€œNo hops were harmed in the brewing of this beer.â€ 

Gruit is an old styleâ€”one that incorporates spices, herbs and fruit but no hops. The latter detail makes this style very rare in modern times. CafÃ© Amsterdamâ€™s Gruit is dark, strong and interesting. This combination of pale and dark malts, sage, thyme, cinnamon, black peppercorn and fresh orange peel composes distinctive, substantial flavors that meld together wonderfully. And at 12% ABV, this cellar-friendly ale is ready to lay you down! Thoroughly enjoy this old-world beer now but stash some away for later dwelvings.

A turn of the century pure malt, crisp lager. 1st Amendment Lager is made with European style hops and Munich malts. This beer has a wonderful, clean, crisp flavor certain to please all.

"Old Slugger" is a hearty Pale Ale, copper in color, crisp malty fullness on the front of the palate and lingering hop bitterness on the back with a dry finish.  It is brewed with four barley malts, including two-row English pale and crystal malts, balanced with Mt. Hood, Cascade and Fuggle hops, and fermented in open vessels by Ringwood Yeast, a true top-fermenting ale yeast. "Old Slugger" is the flagship beer of the Cooperstown Brewing Company and was first brewed in July 1995 and bottled in November 1995.
"Nine Man" is a golden ale, brewed from English pale and crystal malts, and with torrified wheat.  It is bittered with Cascade and Cluster hops and finished with Cascade hops.  "Nine Man Ale" was first brewed as a summer seasonal beer in 1996.   It was kegged the first season but not bottled until the opening of the baseball season in April 1997.
"Benchwarmer" is a very smooth Porter brewed in accordance with the original "high gravity" porters of early London. More than 4% chocolate malt, which is the most similar to the brown malts of the early 1700â€™s, gives "Benchwarmer" its dry coffee-like finish. It is fermented with the Ringwood yeast which is an excellent yeast for the brewing of porters. The widely accepted theory of how porter got its name is that it was a very popular beer among the porters who hauled produce and goods around the marketplace of early industrialized London.
"Strike Out" is brewed with 6 malts including a balanced portion of chocolate and crystal malts. It is also brewed with 5% flaked oats for a velvet-like mouth feel. English pale, Munich and black malt, plus roasted barley round out the malt bill. Considerably lower in alcohol than both Benchwarmer Porter and Old Slugger Pale Ale, "Strike Out" is a well-rounded stout, opaque black in color with a roasted palate.
"Back Yard" is a golden India Pale Ale. Historically, ale shipped to India in the 19th Century was brewed to higher gravities so that it could mature during the long sea voyage. English brewers also hopped these ales heavily to protect them from spoiling. The term "India pale Ale" or "I.P.A." is still used by brewers to denote a super-premium, hoppy pale ale style. Backyard IPA is no exception. English pale barley malt is predominant in this beer with just a small amount of crystal malt. It is well bittered with Cluster and Cascade hops and finished with a mix of local hop and larger amounts of Fuggle hop.
"Pride of Milford" is a very special ale with a tapestry of complex flavors and aromas. It is brewed with five malts and fermented with the Ringwood yeast at a higher temperature which gives this beer a uniqueness all its own. "Pride" has a distinctive reddish copper color. It is strong and rich beer. When "Pride" was first brewed in December 1999, many thought the flavor and aromas of this beer had fruit overtones. No fruit or adjunct flavoring is added to this beer. The unique flavor comes from our special brewing process.

A BIG PALE ALE with an awsome balance of Belgian malts with Fuggles and East Kent Golding hops.
When empirical and creative impulses collide, the result is often timeless. The classic utility-art aesthetic of the coffee maker is an example of design and engineering working in concert. 

It is through similar cooperation that the simple bitter cocoa bean is transformed into a sweet treat. As scientists, our brewers utilize their materials to exacting standards. As artists, they couldnâ€™t resist the temptation to combine two of our highly acclaimed Blackwater Series Imperial Stouts: Jahva and Choklat. Alone each is perfect, but together as Mokah they are an inimitable expression of two of the worldâ€™s most sought after flavors. Enjoy Mokah stout with â€“ or as â€“ your favorite dessert!

The Sculpin IPA is a testament to our humble beginnings as Home Brew Mart. Founded in 1992, the Mart continues to be a catalyst for the San Diego brewing scene, setting the trend for handcrafted ales. Inspired by our customers, employees and brewers, the Sculpin IPA is bright with aromas of apricot, peach, mango and lemon. Its lighter body also brings out the crispness of the hops. This delicious Ballast Point Ale took a Bronze Medal at the 2007 Great American Beer Festival in the Pro Am category. The Sculpin fish has poisonous spikes on its fins that can give a strong sting. Ironically, the meat from a Sculpin is considered some of the most tasty. Something that has a sting but tastes great, sounds like a Ballast Point India Pale Ale.


Our American Brown Ale has a dark brown color, with a balanced aroma of roasted malts and Northwest-grown hops. The sweetness of the ale and crystal malts blend beautifully with the assertive flavors of Cascade and Mt. Hood hops. A brew to be savored.

This beer originated as a prize-winning homebrew many years ago. When Darron, the Head Brewer, began designing the beers for the Pelican Pub and Brewery, he adapted his old 5 gallon homebrew recipe to his new 15 bbl (465 gallon) brewery. It was well worth the effort, for not only has the Doryman's Dark Ale been a perennial favorite here at the Pelican Pub, but it has garnered prestigious professional awards.
We begin with a custom mixture of dark and roasted barley malts, then we add the choicest hops. The resulting ale has a dark chestnut color and a deep nutty flavor. Brewed specially for Trader Joe's.

A-It's got a nice dark tan texture to it. The description on the bottle says it all.

S-It's got a coffee like smell to it. It smells pretty good.

T- It tastes a tad like Bass with a hint of coffee to it. At least to me it had a coffee taste. It's got a nice even taste. It's not too strong and not too weak. It's a happy medium.

M-It feels good when swallowing. It leaves a mild aftertaste but it's a good aftertaste.

D-Well I drank the whole jug w/ no problem and enjoyed myself so that spoke for itself.

Overall, I recommend this beer. If you find it, it's worth having. It goes well when watching a movie too.

Serving type: bottle
Real Louisiana Satsumas, golden wheat, oats and the finest barley create Abita Satsuma Harvest Wit. Pale and cloudy, like the haze on a hot summer day, this white beer has a sweet and subtle citrus flavor with a touch of spice that is cool and refreshing. 

Abita Satsuma Harvest Wit is very versatile and can compliment a number of dishes. This brew pairs well with salads, fish, shrimp and lobster, as long as the dishes are not too spicy. Thai dishes, which often have citric notes in their flavor profile, would also perfectly compliment the orange flavors in Abita Satsuma Harvest Wit.



The brew of choice for mountain bikers, and adventurous types worldwide. (Are you excited now!) This fiery red ale is not for the weak at heart. It originally started out as a Scottish red ale but has taken on flavors of its own. This is a very complex recipe using five different grains to achieve its unique flavor. The caramel malt used is a mixture of Belgian Caravienne and Hugh Bairds Crystal malts. Red Rocket is a full bodied, hoppy brew which finishes on the pallet with caramel malts. Centennial and Cascade hops are used for bittering and aroma.2004 L.A.

Scratch #20 has been dubbed Apollo Imperial Ale because of our experimentation with a new hop variety.
 
Apollo hops are high alpha acid with an intense aroma. Married with other high alpha hops, with almost two pounds of hops added per barrel produced, AIA has an intense staying power in the back of the throat. After a long discussion between Chris, John and the brewers, they dubbed this hop flavor stinky grapefruit with a hint of perfume. The dark color might lead you to believe the some malt may shine through; but no, the hops are the true player in this ale.
 
Scratch #20 has a dual role, also serving at The Drafting Roomâ€™s Anniversary Ale for 2009. We brewed a bit more to serve the brewery and The Drafting Room, but get it while when you see it. Before this intense hop flavor subsides, this beer will be sold out.

Very soft, floral German hops ease the finish into dryness. Available on draft and in bottles from November to March.

Malt, Hops, Pumpkin & our Secret Spices
Originally brewed to celebrate the beginning of the German brewing season and the 1810 wedding of crown prince Ludwig of Bavaria and his bride-to-be, princess Therese of Saxon-Hildburghausen. This amber beer was brewed in March ("Marzenbier") and left to age in cool lagering caves during the heat of the summer. Our rich and satisfying Bavarian-style OctoberFest comes from a special blend of imported German malts that creates a full-bodied brew and stresses a malty flavor and lingering aroma. Gently hopped and delicately balanced, its true-to-style, slow fermentation and long, cold maturation produces a luxuriously smooth, award-winning brew.
By using an exact amount of rye, a grain seldom found in other micro brewed beers, the Rye Pale Ale acquires its signature taste. Made with five varieties of hops and a generous amount of specialty malts, it offers a complex flavor and aroma that is both aggressive and well balanced â€“ a rare find among beers.

The Terrapin Rye Pale Ale was released in Athens, GA in April of 2002 at the Classic City Brew Fest. Six months later this beer which was sold only in Athens was awarded the American Pale Ale Gold Medal at the 2002 Great American Beer Festival, the most prestigious competition in North America. We hope you will agree with our peers in the brewing industry that this is truly one of the best pale ales in the country.
The Terrapin India Style Brown Ale is a head on collision between a hoppy, west coast IPA and a complex, malty brown ale. Brewed with 5 varieties of hops and 7 different malts, this hybrid style represents the best of both worlds.
The Sunray Wheat is a German-style unfiltered wheat beer brewed with a touch of local Georgia Coast Tupelo honey from the Savannah Bee Company.

Its inviting banana and sweet clove like aroma gives way to a pleasant, clean finish with a hint of tartness.

This beer is available in the Terrapin â€œAll The Hitsâ€ Variety 12-pack as well as in individual 6-packs.
Terrapin Beer Company was started by two guys who love big, bold beers. We are known for using a ton of flavorful ingredients and for pushing the envelope with the brews we create.

We have also been known to take pleasure in hiking, biking, kayaking, and just plain having fun in the great outdoors. When we get hot and sweaty even hopheads like us want nothing more than to enjoy a beer that is crisp and refreshing.

Which is why we created the perfect session beer â€“ the Terrapin Golden Ale.
Stone 13th Anniversary Ale pours brilliant deep red with a light tan foam. Up front, the aroma is all piney, resinous and citrus hops. Upon tasting, the hops are still on the front, and they are balanced with the malty, toffee like flavors contributed from the blend of crystal and amber malts used in the brewhouse. The finish is deliciously bitter, with a touch of warmth provided by the 9.5% alcohol. Bitterness comes in at 90+ IBU.

Our flagship beer that embodies the uniqueness and character of the Caribbean. Subtle malt notes start this beer off and it finishes with just the right amount of hops for balance.

Tropical Mango Pale Ale is a light pale ale with a mango fruit essence that is one of a kind taste. No matter where you are enjoying one it will bring you to a Caribbean state of mind.
Dominion Oak Barrel Stout raises the bar for American stouts. We use smoked and peated malts to create an intricate malt foundation.  Willamette and Cascade hops balance the malt character and our method of dry hopping with vanilla beans and oak chips pushes the depth of our stout's flavor spectrum even further.


Also referred to as a Doppelbock, this is the strongest beer made by High Point. Rich creamy head with bouquet of wheat malt, black current, clove, and apple. Deep full flavors of caramel and chocolate malt balance with hops for a smooth warming character. The finish is smooth and malty leading to a subtle alcohol and dark caramel finish. The wonderful balance of this beer provides a complex profile that hides the 9.5% alcohol content. The perfect companion for a cold winter night.
Black ale beer, made with real coffee. This java stout goes through a unique process, involving caramelizing brown sugar to give it an intense caramel & vanilla aroma.

A generous portion of American hops create a crisp citrus nose combined with a light, sweet finish â€“ a well balanced beer that destroys the paradigm of an IPA.
Cascade hops lend this ale a lively and spirited edge that perfectly complements its effervescent amber maltiness.
Scratch #21-2009 is an exercise in deconstruction and minimalism. This Belgian Ale has distinct roots in The Mad Elf minus some key components.
 
The cherries? Gone.
The honey? Gone.
The chocolate malt? Gone.

Wait, this sounds familiar. It almost sounds like a naked version of The Mad Elf.
 
Coming in just under 8% ABV, this unfiltered golden beauty shows off the pronounced yeast flavor that made The Mad Elf famous as well as a touch of alcohol and some mellow malt flavors.
We teamed up with St. Thomas Roasters of Linglestown, PA to create a special blend of espresso beans. They added Kenyan beans to the mix because of a strong citrus flavor that compliments the hops. Creating an environment akin a French press, the beans are combined with whole flower hops in the hopback, and the hot wort passes through the vessel on the way to fermentation giving Java Head a lush coffee espresso nose and hints of coffee flavor. There is a silky quality to the mouthfeel and a citrus aromas from the combination of Kenyan beans and whole flower hops.

Originally brewed for thirsty British troops stationed on the subcontinent of India, India Pale Ales had to withstand the sea voyage around Africa. Brewers need to take full advantage of two preservatives at the time: hops and alcohol. They increased their hopping rates, doubled  their malt useage to increase alcohol content, and dry-hopped the brew before it set out on its voyage.
Our Imperial IPA carries on this tradition- and then some!  The fruity and citrusy hop aroma intermingles perfectly with an assertive malty backbone.  Our brewers added a generous supply of hops to this brew throughout the entire process to provide an enormous hop flavor and balance the elevated alcohol content.

This beer is 11% alcohol by volume, and 135 IBU!
Brewed in collaboration with brewmaster Toshi Ishii from Yo-Ho Brewing, Japan. 

Malt: lager, mÃ¼nchener, crystal 
Hops: Millennium, Centennial, Chinnok, Amarillo and Brewers Gold.

Brewery folklore tells a story about a train engineer with a passion for the taste of Railbender Ale. With every stop he made in Erie came an equal number of stops at our brewery. One extended visit to our fermenter left the engineer in a rather befuddled state of mind. On his fateful trip out of Erie that evening, his train mysteriously derailed. The engineer swears that a huge black cherry tree had fallen across the tracks as the culprit. No such tree was ever found, but the front of the locomotive was spattered with hundreds of red sports. In tribute to this folklore our expert brewers introduce Derailed Black Cherry Ale â€“ brewed with fresh sweet black cherries and the finest malted barley to create a truly cherrylicious ale. Please enjoy responsibly, as we would never want you to get derailed!
Big DIPA â€“ Double IPA,  is the first in the Heavy Seas Special Edition Series due to be released in mid June.  Hopped 3 times in the brewing process, Big DIPA has an earthy hop aroma.  In keeping with the Heavy Seas philosophy we've made a big beer with a surprising balance. The best part is that youâ€™ll hardly notice itâ€™s 10.6% ABV (est). The label artwork was created by Kurt Krol, one of our brewers who also helped to develop the recipe.
A hop lover and beer connoisseur's favorite, this ale is surprisingly drinkable and fully delights with its hoppy aromatics. Stick your nose in this one.
A deep-red, full-bodied, malty ale heavily hopped with Centennial hops to produce a citrusy, spruce-like flavor and aroma. A final dose of Centennail hops in the conditioning tank lends an India Pale Ale-like aroma to the finished beer.

The Andygator is a fearsome beast...much too big for any little bottle. Don't let his toothy grin, slightly sweet flavor and subtle fruit aroma fool you: this cold-blooded creature is a Helles Doppelbock that can sneak up on you. Sip, don't gulp and taste the wild of Abita Andygator
Red Chair IPA is named after the oldest operating lift at Mt. Bachelor, a classic old school double that locals flock to on fresh powder mornings. This beer has been wildly popular with our pub regulars, who always seem to know when we have hit on something special. 

This IPA is a bright copper beauty with a solid head and perfect lacing that typifies Deschutes ales. It has a plush body with satiny caramel flavors derived from seven varieties of malt. Despite all of this, Red Chair is still a hop forward ale, but not in the way many have gotten used to. You will find no cloying, mouth puckering bitterness here. In its place a straight up succulent citrus punch to the nose.
An invigorating wheat beer with 100% organic grains, a hint of rye and the tang and hue of organic hibiscus, this refreshing brew is as cool as the breeze that blows down from Mount Mitchell to Cattail Peak. Enjoy this delicious creation when the hottest summer day demands the best of the Blue Ridge.
Dark Knight (Baltic Porter) A Baltic porter is kind of a cross between an English porter and an Imperial Stout. Ours features a rich maltiness with hints of caramel, toffee and chocolate in both the flavor and aroma. Restrained hopping contributes a smooth full finish.
This tasty English pale ale gets its charm from Imported Maris Otter Pale Malt, East Kent goldings and a few secret ingredients to keep our competitiors guessing. Styled after a classic English Bitter, Urban Wilderness is supremely balanced, smooth and easy to drink.

It usually means bigger. Richer. And we can think of no better way to describe the taste of this even-bolder take on our classic, Black Butte Porter. Black Butte XX is an imperial porter with a lot more malt and hops, a wealth of coffee, cocoa nibs and aged in bourbon oak barrels. XX. It also means 20. Enjoy one during our 20th anniversary. On the flavor scale - Itâ€™s legendary.

Fermented with the Augustinerbrau yeast strain, Kellar Fest is a blend of Bohemian Pils, Munich and Vienna malts.

Grab a lamb handle and savor this Kellar Fest.
A rich, smooth...long dry-roast finish...ebony
A fruity, copper-colored ale with a firm maltiness & dry hop.
An American style India Pale Ale. This medium bodied, light bronze hued brew has an aggressive hop character and flavor from the use of American hops in dry hopping. Our interpretation comes in at 13.0 degrees plato with IBUâ€™s in the mid 40â€™s. The American hop varietals used as Kettle additions were Amarillo and Chinook and this was dry hopped with Chinook as well.

Lion Imperial Lager, from Sri Lanka, is brewed using the finest natural ingredients - delivering a rich smooth taste and refreshment. Enjoy its bite.
A light copper body low bitterness with good hop flavor. This is my impression of what the English troops may have been drinking when they occupied India. The pale ale they drank had mellowed considerably. The wooden casks had spent many months traveling on ships and long inland journeys to the troops, where they were then tapped and enjoyed.
Gouden Carolus Hopsinjoor completes the taste pallet of the gamma Carolus-beers.  

"Hopsinjoor" is a wordplay to for one thing the several hops which were used, and on the other hand the typical character of Mechelen of Gouden Carolus: the figure "opsinjoor" is intertwined with the history of Mechelen.  

4 types of hops are used: Golding, Spalt, Hallertau and Saaz. These hops were fractioned at several times in the cooking process in order to keep a maximum of aroma.

Regarding to taste we can say that the beer has a gentle, but nevertheless bitter aftertaste. Gold-yellow colour. Hoppy aroma.
This dark lager combines the characteristics of three winter beer styles. All three of these styles traditionally come from the colder harsher areas of Europe. The styles are (1) Black Beer (aka schwartzbier) originating from the former East Germany); (2) Rye Beer which at one time was only made in hardier areas of Eastern and Baltic Europe; and (3) Bock Beer which is widely known as a higher alcohol lager of Northern Germany. Our Black Rye Bock has a distinctive bitter chocolate palate and black color reminiscent of a black beer. The spiciness from the rye malt shines through in the flavor. The high alcohol balanced with malty sweetness rounds out this cold season bock. Smooth drinking with a punch makes this lager a perfect quaffer for our Arctic winter. 6.2% alcohol by volume.
Inspired by old-world brewing methods, this bewitching all-malt brew is a darkly rich, exotic lager, crafted with a touch of magical New Orleans spirit.
Terrapin Midnight Project Brew Two 2009. Sometime around midnight in a city nobody can agree on, the idea for Terrapin and Left Hand to brew a collaboration beer was born. Depth Charge is the second in the series of one-time releases between the two breweries. Be wary of the calm before the storm. This creamy, deeply delicious milk stout will seduce you into submission while the explosion of hand roasted gourmet espresso will blow you into next week. We Shall Drink in the breweries. We Shall Drink in the pubs, We Shall Drink the the comfort of our homes. We Shall Never Surrender.

A robust porter brewed with lots of chocolate malt and roasted barley. This gives the beer its nearly black color and coffee and dark chocolate flavors. These flavors are then tempered with the use of flaked oats which provide an almost creamy texture to the beer. The 7.7% abv is deceptive but is not completely unnoticed.



Smuttynose Pumpkin Ale is our homage to the craft and heritage of Americaâ€™s brewers. Recipes calling for the use of pumpkins in beer date back to early colonial times, when brewers sought to extend their supply of costly imported malt with locally grown ingredients, such as squash and â€œpompions.â€

In that spirit, we brew our ale with the addition of pumpkin to the mash, along with traditional spices to create a delicious American original.
This kick ass American Barley Wine is all about hops â€”Nugget, Chinook, Simcoe and Centennial. And, yeah, LoTs of â€˜em. OKâ€¦thereâ€™s a substantial malt base on which these juicy Pacific NW hops lie down and do their dirty work. Maybe thatâ€™s too much infoâ€¦
The style was first brewed in England for the Russian Czar and it is the king of stouts. Plenty of big malt flavors- chocolate and roasted- and high alcohol with lower carbonation and mild hops. 
We brewed this beer with double the malts and four times the hops of regular stouts!

Otter Creek Russian Imperial Stout clocks in around 10% ABV- a beer to be savored responsibly. True to style, this beer will last for years so you may want to stock up on a few bottles for your cellar while it's available.

Russian Imperial Stouts pair well with creamy cheeses such as camembert (we recommend Vermont-made!), decadent chocolate desserts, or a hearty meal.

Brace yourself, bereaved fans of Stone 11th Anniversary Ale, for your joyous new day has finally come! Itâ€™s like your first crushâ€“you know, the one who broke your heart when she/he decided to go to the junior prom with whatâ€™s-their-nameâ€“has suddenly come back to you to go for a cruise down the main drag on Friday night. Itâ€™s likeâ€¦itâ€™s like finding that long lost gold watch, given to you by your father, who got it from his father, who got it from his father. Itâ€™s like when your best buddy in the world, Sam the family dog, finally sauntered up the front porch steps one sunny afternoon after having been on a six-week runaway. Yes, itâ€™s just like that.

And itâ€™s like this: A brilliantly hopped double IPAâ€“providing a wake up call of floral and citrus aromasâ€“backed up by a deliciously smooth and dark roasted maltiness. You get the best of both worlds with this black double IPA.
Abbaye Saint-Martin Brune was named World's Best Abbey (Dark) Beer @ the 2009 World Beer Awards (London). Aroma of caramel and liquorice.  Less sweet than most traditional Dark Abbey Ales. Many people prefer this double at room temperature. It is especially popular when paired with dessert.

A unique 7% Belgian blonde ale, flavoured with juniper berries. The beer has bittersweet malt flavours, and a heady perfumed aroma of orange and juniper.
Our Fall Seasonal, Pumpkin Patch Ale, is the perfect beer for an autumn night. Pumpkin Patch pours a hazy orange with frothy, ivory colored head.

Medium body and mild carbonation yield a spicy, pumpkin flavor - from the 300 lbs. of pumpkin we use to brew this unique beer.


The unofficial name for this beer is â€œSuper Glideâ€. Malty rich with a hint of spicy hops and roasted grains. This beer is one smooth ride with a clean finish! We brewed this one with American Pale, oats, flaked barley, black, chocolate, red malt, melandolin malt. American hops include Magnum, Centennial, Liberty and Crystal. Enjoy!
We brewed THE VERMONSTER with 110 pounds of malt per barrel and jacked up the pour into a wide mouth thin glass goblet. For an amazing pairing get some Smoked Gouda from Taylor Farm Cheese and a friend!
This beer is an Imperial version of our Black Strap Stout, this time brewed with MORE blackstrap molasses and MORE brown sugar, plus a whole lot more malt and hops too.  Part of our FESTIVAL OF DARKNESS, this one clocks in at over 10%ABV, and is the thickest beer we've ever brewed here.
The extensive distance between two breweries on the West Coast â€“ 3767 miles â€“ is bridged by this collaboration beer. Brewers Gabe Fletcher of Midnight Sun Brewing Company [Anchorage, AK] and Colby Chandler of Ballast Point Brewing Company [San Diego, CA] designed and brewed an exciting representation of their passions: hops, Belgian yeast, oak aging and Brettanomyces. 

Just prior to the Great Alaska Beer & Barley Wine Fest in JAN 2009, Gabe and Colby brewed a West Coast-worthy IPA at Midnight Sun Brewing Company. This hop-centric beer became the jumping-off point for other intense flavors. During its course to completion, 3767 was affected by three different yeast strains--including Brettanomyces, aged for several months in French oak Cabernet Sauvignon barrels, and then bottle- and keg-conditioned. 
The plan is for 3767 to hit Anchorage, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco and San Diego in NOV 2009 for a West Coast Toast. Hereâ€™s to the collaborative spirit readily found in our brewing industry. Clink!
Close your eyes. The delicate aroma, flavor, texture of this beer whisper â€œwitbierâ€. Now open your eyes. The color is deceiving. You take another sip. Yes, witbier â€¦ but black as night. It is something quite peculiarâ€”BuT it is brilliantâ€”something shimmering and [not so] white.
During even the coldest of weather, warm up to the smooth, robust taste of our Winter's Bourbon Cask Ale. Full of rich aromas that you find in the winter months, hints of vanilla and flavorful hops, this is a beer that is great for pouring into a large tulip glass and enjoying with friends around a fireplace.
Tournay Black is a bottle conditioned, Belgian stout brewed by Brasserie de Cazeau which is a farm-brewery located in the south of Belgium.  It was originally brewed as a winter ale under the name Tournay de Noel, but later became a year-round release.  They didn't provide much specific detail about how it was brewed except to say that it is made with water, malts, candi-sugar, hops, and yeast.  It is 7.6% ABV with a recommended drinking temperature of +/- 50 degrees.  The brewer states that the tasting notes are of, "roasted malts, coffee, bitter chocolate, earth, and cigar ash."  Well, I am a prodigious cigar smoker and I can't say that I would want to consume the ash.


Our Big A IPA has earned its share of praise over the last few years. In 2004 the New York Times named it its top IPA , and in 2007 Mens Journal Magazine included it on its list of 25 best beers in America. The last of each year's edition typically leaves our warehouse around mid-May, and, as always, it doesn't last long. 

Stash Wojciechowski, the â€œKiller Kielbasa,â€ created this bonafide India Pale Ale recipe exclusively for the Smuttynose Big Beer Series.

OK, what do you get when we toss pale malted barley, pumpkin and spices into a stainless steel cauldron then stir in some magic? Uh, Trickster! The â€œmagicâ€ is actually mischievous Belgian yeast at play with cardamom, nutmeg and coriander. This spooky cool brew will make your glass glow bright despite the gloominess of the season. 

Designed to conjure up a little fun during the darkening days of autumn, Trickster is a frivolous concoction of earthy pumpkin, comforting malt, and lively spices. This makes Trickster the brew to accompany your post-winterizing duties, family fall dinners, ghost stories, U-boast-iT stories, and â€œsupposedly hauntedâ€ garage parties. 

But the flavor range of Trickster also pairs well with citrusy and spicy cuisine. Try a glowing glass with your favorite dishes that incorporate nutmeg, cardamom or corianderâ€”like Thai curries, Swedish meatballs, gingerbread, roasted pumpkin soup. Add Trickster to soups and sauces, batters and doughs, glasses and mugs.
Vicious and viscous, this menacing brew pours opaque black with a creamy maduro-colored head. Its aroma offers seductive whiskey, chewy red wine, dark fruit and lavish tobacco. Berserker Imperial Stout invades your taste buds with in-your-face flavor. Weighing in at almost 13% alcohol by volume, Berserker is completely out-of-control. Give it a good fight.

This version of Berserker Imperial Stout was aged in both red wine and whiskey barrels. The entire batch was brought back together before being packaged in kegs and 22-oz bottles.
Brewed in the authentic historical style of an Imperial Russian Stout, this ale is massive. Intensely aromatic (notes of anise, lack currants, coffee, roastiness and alcohol) and heavy on the palate, this brew goes where few can --- and fewer dare even try. The style originated from Czarist Russia's demand for ever thicker English stouts. Expect our version of this mysterious brew to pour like Siberian crude and taste even heavier!
Born of dark and cold and snow in the marrow of the northeast's longest night, HOWL comes in on wailing winds with winter-weary eyes burning holes in sunless shadows. In its darkened depths out inner voids are warmed.
Our golden American ale has a crisp body and slightly dry, hoppy finish. This is a real treat for the beer lover. Pale, wheat and torrified wheat malts are used with Northern Brewer and Mt. Hood hops.
Lupulin Rapture Incarnate! As fervent Â devotees of hops, we found ourselves on a quest to create a transcendental IPA capable of quenching our voracious lupulin desires. Our mantra became "unity of bitterness, hop flavor and aroma." Enlightened, duganA IPA was born: A brutally bitter, dank, piney and resinous ale designed for those seeking a divine hop experience.
A Brewer's Select Series, Golf is a fest-weisse hybrid or 'Festeweizen.' It will weigh in at 5.0% and is made with Munich, Wheat, and CaraVienna malts and Spalt hops.
Our India Pale Ale is hoppy and bitter with a nice sweet malt finish. Slow dry-hop conditioning brings out the herbal hop aromas.
Razberry Wheat is crisp with a refreshing tartness and the fresh aroma of raspberries. This salmon pink ale is just the thing to transport you to berry time in the summer.
Celtic Copper is a mahogany hued ale with rich malt flavor and subtle hop balance; an excellent choice for those who prefer amber ales.
Ring Tail Pale is light in body and straw-gold in color, with a crisp hop finish. This beer is a great choice for domestic lager drinkers.
Our Blond Bock is gold in color and features a malty profile and a spicy finish courtesy of Saaz hops. This beer boasts the flavor of a traditional Bock without the cloying aftertaste.
Features the intense aroma of fresh-picked, slow ripened Northwest apricots warmed by the summer sun. Based on a Belgian Tripel, this beer went through 16 months lactic fermentation and aging in French oak wine barrels.
A Belgian Flanders Style Red Ale refermented with a sweet blend of fresh whole Northwest cherries. This beer spent more than six months of lactic fermentation and aging in small French oak wine barrels before being hand-bottled.
A careful blending of select barrels of Flanders Reds and soured Belgian Triples aged in oak for up to 18 months. Then blended with fresh 25Â° Plato Blond Quadruppel. Hand-bottled, corked and then aged allowing lactic fermentation.
This Northwest style sour red is a bottled version of our popular Mouton Rouge. This blend of barrels, with up to 16 months of oak barrel lactic fermentation and oak barrel aging, features dark fruit, sour, oak and funk flavors that sweep over your taste buds like an incoming tide.
Exit 11 Hoppy American Wheat Ale is the second in their wildly popular Exit Series of Big Bottle Beers. Exit 11 is a confluence of styles and ingredients, just as Exit 11 is the point in New Jersey where the Garden State Parkway, the New Jersey Turnpike and several other highways come together.

â€œExit 11 is the point on the Turnpike where the Garden State Parkway branches off and takes hundreds of thousands of travelers to the renowned Jersey Shore,â€ says Flying Fish Founder Gene Muller.  â€œOur Exit 11 Wheat Ale is a fresh, citrus-y summer beer perfect for beachgoers and those who only wish they were headed â€˜downa shoreâ€™.â€

Exit 11 is an American-style wheat beer brewed with English ale yeast and three Pacific Northwest hops, Columbus, Palisade and Amarillo.  It is brewed with 50% Belgian pale malt and 50% white wheat, and is an ideal summer thirst quencher, with its bouquet of tangerines and apricots. Exit 11 is available only during this one-time release, and only until it sells out across New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware.
A Craft Amber Ale, brewed using Honey from Northern Mexico.
This beer has changed hands a bit over its 60+ year history - first brewed by the Grain Belt Brewery in Minneapolis, then by the now-defunct Minnesota Brewing and currently by August Schell Brewing Co. in New Ulm.
This mahogany ale packs a lingering, earthy hoppiness. The addition of more than 20% rye to the grain bill gives a creamy mouthfeel and hints of spice that compliment the bitterness of hops. Subtle fruitiness come through from the Bravo hops added during the boil, but the Cluster and Liberty varieties used in dry-hopping this beer are the true flavor drivers in this spicy ale. Dark in color and intense is flavor, Scratch 25-2009 finds true balance in a beer that could have easily gone way over the top. Enjoy.
This 6% trans-atlantic fusion IPA is light golden in colour with tropical fruits and light caramel on the nose. The palate soon becomes assertive and resinous with the New Zealand hops balanced by the biscuit malt. The finish is aggressive and dry with the hops emerging over the warming alcohol.

This fresh, full flavour natural beer is our tribute to the classic IPAs of yester-year. The post modern twist is the addition of amazing fruity hops giving an explosion of tropical fruit flavours and a sharp bitter finish.
A strong, silky smooth imperial stout with a deep, dark ruby appearance. Mocha, bitter chocolate, liquorice and dark cherry flavours prevail, before the balanced, warming and encapsulating finish.

A contemporary Scottish take on an age old Russian classic style originally brewed for the Tsars. Our interpretation brings together hops from both sides of the Atlantic, amazing flavoured malts and dark sugars.

Like the original BrewDog, this beer would never bite you but would much rather give you a lick on the face. Look Out!

Serving Suggestion: Enjoy with an air of aristocratic nonchalance



This little bottle has a grandiloquent story to tell.

2,204 malted Maris Otter grains gave all they had to offer the world to provide the robustly delicate toffee malt canvas for the ensuing epic.

6 Hop Cones willingly sacrificed themselves in fiery cauldron that is our brew kettle to ensure your mouth is left feeling punished and puckering for more.

9,900,000,000 yeast cells frantically fermented their little hearts out as the sugars were magically turned into alcohol in the dark depths of our fermentation tanks.

This explicit ale has more hops and bitterness that any other beer brewed in the UK. This is an extreme beer rollercoaster for freaks, gypsies and international chess superstars.
A titillating, neurotic, peroxide, punk of a pale ale. Combining attitude, style substance and a little bit of low self esteem for good measure; what would your mother say?

You really should just leave it alone...

...but you just cant get the compulsive malt body and gorgeous dirty blonde colour out of your head. The seductive lure of the sassy passion fruit hop proves too much to resist. All that is even before we get onto the fact that there are no additives preservatives, pasteurization or strings attached.

All wrapped up with the customary Brewdog bite and imaginative twist. This trashy blonde is going to get you into a lot of trouble.
A Lager that actually tastes of something?

You have to be kidding, right?

77 lager is made with 100% malt and whole leaf hops.

It contains no preservatives, additives, cheap substitutes or any other junk.

Maybe we are crazy. So what?

Taste 77 Lager and we are pretty sure you will agree that the fine line between genius and insanity has just become a little more blurred.
Dogma is an innovative, enigmatic ale brewed with guarana, poppy seeds and kola nut all blended together with Scottish heather honey. A conspiracy of transcontinental ingredients infused with some devastatingly BrewDog imaginative thinking.

The flavours, intricacies and nuances of this beer are best enjoyed while musing over some obscure 17th Century philosophical meanderings, such as:

"If we disbelieve everything because we cannot certainly know all things we will do much, what as wisely as he who would not use his wings but sit still and perish because he had no wings to fly."
John Locke.

This beer is not cool. You may think it is, but that is just a beautiful lie fabricated by clowns and gypsies.
The irony of existentialism, the parody of being and the inherent contradictions of post-modernism, all so delicately conveyed by the blocky, pixelated arcade action have all been painstakingly recreated in this bottles contents.

This imperial stout is brewed with copious amounts of speciality malts, jasmine and cranberries. After fermentation we then dry-hop this killer stout with a bucketload of our favourite hops before carefully ageing the beer on French toasted oak chips.

It is all about moderation. Everything in moderation, including moderation itself. What logically follows is that you must, from time, have excess. This beer is for those times.

This is the worlds strongest ever beer, ever (yes ever).

No Penguins  were harmed in the making of this beer; some humans did get very, very cold though. It was worth it.

The Antarctic name, inducing schizophrenia, of this Å¸ber-imperial stout originates from the amount of time it spent exposed to extreme cold. This beer was initially double barrel aged for 14 months; maturing in the deep, rich oak of Scottish whisky casks. After this epic maturation the beer was then frozen, then frozen again, then frozen again.

This is an extremely strong beer, it should be enjoyed in small servings and with an air of aristocratic nonchalance. In exactly the same manner that you would enjoy a fine whisky, a Frank Zappa album or a visit from a friendly yet anxious ghost.
Here ye, here yeâ€¦All hopheads shall herewith rejoice! Terrapin has recruited ye old HOPSECUTIONER to execute the exact hop profile for this killer IPA!
Black as night, this coffee stout is thick, rich and full of real coffee flavor. Brewed with the Terrapin Wake-n-Bake coffee blend created by Terrapin & Jittery Joeâ€™s Coffee.

Before filtering the final batch of 2008 Mad Elf we racked some beer into bourbon barrels for six weeks of tender loving care. After bottling, we aged the beer for approximately eight months. This allows the tart cherries to push to the front. Subtle vanilla, bourbon, charred wood, coconut and toasted nut endnotes emanate from Splinter Red.
The transformation of Scratch #3-2007 to Splinter Gold has been a slow rest in oak wine barrels dosed with brettanomyces. During a two-year aging period the horsy flavors of the brett combined with the Westmalle yeast used during primary fermentation to create a complex blend of flavors. Bone-dry and 12% abv, Splinter Gold is highly carbonated.
â€œRobust, Dark and Smooth, hold on to your hat cause youâ€™ll lose your feet on this one!â€ Brewed with pale, dark crystal, Munich, flaked barley, black and chocolate malts. Hops include Cascade, Crystal, Challenger and Perle.

A richer shade of Red. Summit has artfully crossed the boundaries of traditional IPA and Amber styles to create a brew all our own. Featuring an aromatic blend of Horizon, Amarillo and Cascade hops with nicely balanced malts for a flavor youâ€™ll enjoy to the fullest.
A seasonal winter beer from Brooklyn
An 'American Farmhouse Ale.' It's a Belgian-inspired brew that uses a combination of European malts, hops from New New Zealand and the United States.. and a classic farmhouse yeast to achieve a fruity, yet spicy, melange of flavors and aroma.
Jai Alai IPA is a monster interpretation of an American IPA. In fact, it is so big that it equals the alcohol of some double IPAs on the market. Our IPA uses 6 different hop varietals, with Simcoe hops only being used for dry hopping. The rest of the hop additions are blended at different IBU's (International Bittering Units) in groups of three hops per addition in order to create more hop complexity. At CCB, we love hops but also feel that balance is important for IPAs. So Jai Alai features a sturday caramel malt component which helps to create balance, staving off hop astringency. Ultimately, Jai Alai is a very strong interpretation of a single American IPA. We hope that it makes Tampa Bay natives happy because this is head brewer Wayne Wamble's favorite Cigar City beer and he'd love to share one with you!
Maduro is a Northern English-style brown ale with some American affectations. It is unlike the typical American Brown Ale, as it doesnâ€™t have the big hop character common in American-brewed Brown Ales. And Maduro is higher in alcohol than the common English brown ale. Maduro also has oats, in the malt bill which imparts a silky body and aids in making the roasted, toasted and chocolate components mesh together in Maduro's complex malt profile. The end result is a remarkably full flavored yet approachable and sessionable brown ale that pairs well with cigars.
This Russian Imperial Stout is dedicated to Gregory Zhukov. Arguably one of World War II's finest generals and a man bold enough to appreciate the rich, complex flavors of a beer brewed to fortify a body through the Russian winter. Like military geniuses, Russian Imperial Stouts reach their peak with a little age on them, so we release Marshal Zhukov's Russian Imperial Stout in sweltering August so that it will be at peak flavor come January or February.

Opaque black in color, the aroma has notes of espresso, chocolate, dark sweet toffee with hints of black strap molasses. The flavor starts with an unsweetened chocolate character and supporting notes of herbal dryness from English hop varietals. It then moves into dark toffee sweetness and closes with a slap of roasty espresso. Zhukov's Imperial Stout pairs well with Mushroom Solyanka, dark chocolate, cherries and ground wars in Russia.  Enjoy, comrade.
Guava Grove is a Saison which is fermented with guava. The guava adds sweetness and acidity to the prodigious fruity esters imparted by the warm fermentation temperatures  of the Belgian yeast strain.
Big Sound Scotch Ale is dedicated to our good buddy Gino, the most punk rock bagpiper you'll ever meet, and the rest of the men and women of Tampa Bay Pipes and Drums. Brown in color, Big Sound has huge notes of dark sweet toffee with underlying mild notes of coffee in the aroma. The flavor starts with a slight note of cherry and then opens into a Goliath of a malt character with notes of dark sweet toffee, slight hints of coffee and mild notes of toasted bread in the finish. Big Sound Scotch Ale pairs well with Haggis, Highland Games, Huge Heads and Enormous Pillows and of course Bagpipe music.

This is our offering to the hop heads! A decidedly hoppy, bitter, and moderately strong American IPA. We use a generous amount of whole leaf Cascade, Centennial and Citra hops to showcase the freshness and earthy flavors that only hops can provide.
An intense and rich, dark, roasty ale with substantial alcohol warming. Requires several months of aging.
A crisp, clean, easy drinking, refreshing American ale with a light body.
Important: let this beer warm to at least 50Â° before enjoying.  This beer is black with some ruby highlights.  The nose is full of pumpkin pie spices and some alcohol.  There are notes of nutmeg, caraway and vanilla.  The taste starts with chocolate malt with a hint of spice and rolls into a warm spicy alcohol taste which has the effect of creating the balance that usually comes from the hop bitter.  There is some hop bitter on the finish, but not much.  Overall, this beer finishes relatively dry for such a big beer.  As it warms, the spices move forward in the taste and the chocolate moves to the finish.  The pumpkin provides a pleasant undertone and a nice mouthfeel.  The spices will probably fade some over time; they mellowed considerably while still in the fermenter.
Our winter seasonal is inspired by the great ales of the UK but brewed with a distinctively American attitude. English crystal malt gives Phoenixx its subtle toffee and caramel notes, but this ale is about hops. The blend of English hops, highlighted by its namesake, Phoenix, yields a complex hop character that dominates this special brew.
Made in the style of the Belgian wheat beers that are so refreshing, (512) Wit is a hazy ale spiced with coriander and domestic grapefruit peel. 50% US Organic 2-row malted barley and 50% US unmalted wheat and oats make this a light, crisp ale well suited for any occasion.
With Organic 2-row malted barley, (512) Pale is a copper colored American Pale Ale that balances earthy hop bitterness and hop flavor with a rich malty body.
(512) India Pale Ale is a big, aggressively dry-hopped American IPA with smooth bitterness (~65 IBU) balanced by medium maltiness. Organic 2-row malted barley, loads of hops, and great Austin water create an ale with apricot and vanilla aromatics that lure you in for more.
Nearly black in color, (512) Pecan Porter is made with Organic US 2-row and Crystal malts along with Bairdâ€™s Chocolate and Black malts. Its full body and malty sweetness are balanced with subtle pecan aroma and flavor from locally grown pecans. Yet another true Austin original!
(512) ALT is a German-style amber ale that is fermented cooler than typical ales and cold conditioned like a lager. ALT means â€œoldâ€ in German and refers to a beer style made using ale yeast after many German brewers had switched to newly discovered lager yeast. This ale has a very smooth, yet pronounced, hop bitterness with a malty backbone and a characteristic German yeast character. Made with 98% Organic 2-row and Munch malts and US noble hops.
At once cuddly and ferocious, (512) BRUIN combines a smooth, rich maltiness and mahogany color with a solid hop backbone and stealthy 7.6% alcohol. Made with Organic 2 Row and Munich malts, plus Chocolate and Crystal malts, domestic hops, and a touch of molasses, this brew has notes of raisins, dark sugars, and cocoa, and pairs perfectly with food and the crisp fall air.
Our first barrel project is in kegs and on itâ€™s way to beer bars around Austin. This is a bigger, bolder version of our mainstay Pecan Porter, with a richer finish. Two months on recently emptied Jack Daniels select barrels imparted a wonderful vanilla character from the oak and a pleasant amount of whiskey nose and flavor. All in all, Iâ€™m really proud of the hard work and effort put into this beer. Our first attempt at brewing it and our first attempt at managing barrels has paid off for everyone! Seek out this beer, but donâ€™t put it off. There is a very limited number of kegs available and it might go fastâ€¦

Samuel Adams Noble Pils is one of the only brews made with all five Noble hops from the worldâ€™s growing regions. its bright flavor and lively, citrus hop character reminds us that the warm days of spring are just a few weeks away.
Scratch #27-2010 begins a new fold in the Scratch series. For the next several batches individual Troegs brewers will create recipes of their choice. First up, The Ticeman had a hankering for a sweet stout, so the Troegs brothers and all the brewers met with Scharffen Berger Chocolate Company engineers to eat ridiculous amounts of cocoa nibs and chocolates over a few pints of beer.

This collaboration resulted in the delivery of a special blend of cocoa nibs that were added during the boiling process. In addition to the nibs, lactose was added at the end of the boil to give a little sweetness in the body. The addition of Galena and Simcoe hops lends a subtle fruity balance. After primary fermentation, the beer was aged for three weeks on a blend of cocoa nibs and Ugandan vanilla beans.

Dubbed Cocaoabunga, this unfiltered beer has a pleasant cocoa aroma, a subtle sweetness in the mouthfeel, a full-bodied flavor, and hints of vanilla. Enjoy!
One of the first beers I brewed after moving out to California to begin my brewing education was a Pale Ale. This version is a true testament to the influences the Wild West had on my early brewing. My Pale Ale is loaded with US-grown Cascade, Crystal, and Columbus hops, so be sure to take a good sniff to enjoy their robust aromas before taking your first sip.
This beer is the result of the marriage between two very distinct beer styles; the Belgian Tripel & American IPA. We have taken the best qualities from both styles and allowed them to shine through. The fruity and spicy notes from the imported Belgian yeast strain & the pungent flavors and aromas of the American grown Amarillo hops flow seamlessly together to create this flavorful ale.  Straight from the Captainâ€™s cellar to yours, we hope you enjoy.
Don't let the golden color fool you - this isn't your father's lite beer!

Brewed with imported German malts and US-grown hops, this beer is a full-flavored introduction to craft-brewed beer. We add the hops late in the boil, allowing you to enjoy the flavor and aroma of the hops without an aggressive bitterness.
A complex beer, with layers of flavors unfolding as this beer slides down your throat. Before the introduction of indirect-fired malt kilns, all beers had a smoky flavor. Today only a handful of brewers produce beer reminiscent of those of the past. We use imported German smoked malt to add depth and complexity to our Smoked Porter.
This beer is a salute to the ingenuity and creativity of the American craft brewers. A uniquely American style of beer, the Double or Imperial IPA, has become the calling card of many craft brewers who aren't afraid to push the limits of what hops can add to a beer. This beer is big and hoppy - not for the faint of heart! Be prepared to experience sensory overload as you savor this Imperial IPA.
This beer was created as a summer thirst quencher, because we all know how hot and humid it can get in New York during the summer. We brewed this beer using both coriander and orange peel in the boil to increase both the aroma and flavor of this beer. Make sure you donâ€™t get burned this summer, drink your Sun Block.
Named after the little birds that fly by the brewery looking for grain after the weather turns cold, this was originally to be a Fall/Winter seasonal. Clearly we underestimated the market for this smooth and malty brown ale, and we have decided to keep it for year round enjoyment.
This is a truly unique brew, combining some unusual elements to create a powerful, yet flavorful brew. I brewed a similar beer to this one back in 1998, while I was home brewing out in California. Only this time around I decided to age it in bourbon barrels to add a new element to the already rich sensory profile. The combination of dark malt, elderberries and bourbon barrels makes for an interesting tasting experience. This is a sippinâ€™ beer, so sit back by the fire and enjoy. 12% alcohol by volume.
Thereâ€™s nothing quite likes Momâ€™s apple pieâ€¦But I am willing to bet this beer is pretty darn close.  An American Tripel, dry-hoped with Amarillo hops and aged in Apple Brandy barrels from one of this countryâ€™s oldest distilleries.  The tropical aroma of the hops and the delicate apple aroma from the barrels are a perfect match.  Straight from the Captainâ€™s cellar to yours, we hope you enjoy.
Brewed with New York State Blueberries and Brettanomyces, Le Bleu is a blend of barrels filled in 2007, 2008, and 2009. It's finished in the bottle with Champagne yeast.  

Enjoy the dusty rose appearance, mouthwatering aroma of ripe berries, piquant flavor and quick finish.

â€œTwo inflammatory words... one wild drink. Nectar imprisoned in a bottle. Let it out. It is cruel to keep a wild animal locked up. Uncap it. Release it....stand back!! Wallow in its golden glow in a glass beneath a white foaming head. Remember, enjoying a RAGING BITCH, unleashed, untamed, unbridled- and in heat- is pure GONZO!! It has taken 20 years to get from there to here. Enjoy!â€

Chaotic yet hypnotic, Mayhem is a deliberate Double IPA, brewed and conditioned with a special Belgian yeast that contributes complexity and spice. Abundant American hops offer grapefruit, pine, must and mint, which play off the fullness and sweetness of pale malts then provide a biting yet enticing finish.

Mayhem Double IPA accents the complex spice combinations found in Thai, Indian, Cajun, Morrocan, Mexican and Southwest American cuisines as well as BBQ marinades, dry rubs and sauces.

Mayhem creates MAYHEM.
Beer Description:
This double bock provides smooth sailin' in rough seas. The fact that this luscious lager was aged in rum barrels creates the illusion that the open sea is a safe place. And while riding out these waves of grain, you may fall victim to the dangers of pirates, rum, bock. OK...maybe the beach is a bit over-rated.
This gruit ale was inspired by the Phish song of the same name. A traditional gruit in style, Bathtub Gin was brewed without hops. Instead Ben spiced his beer with botanicals typically used to flavor gin: juniper berries, orris root, angelica root, grains of paradise, lemon peel, orange peel and coriander. The result is intensely fragrant, flavorful and fabulous.
Neolithic humans evolved from nomadic hunters into a more settled agricultural society, changing life forever. The â€˜founderâ€™ crops they raised included wheat and barley. It is little surprise that the first examples of brewing appeared during this age.

Brewers owe much to the epoch. Similarly, we thank our farmer friends of today for cultivating the ingredients the are responsible for the beers we now enjoy. Their laborious days spent ourdoors under the hot sun earn them respect, as well as a mark of distinction: the farmer's tan. Yes, the inevitable red and white hallmark of hard work.
The latest in our Brewersâ€™ Select One-offs, India is a West Coast style IPA at [7.2%] ABV, with incredibly delicious hoppiness! Golden in color, this beer is tilted way over toward the hops by way of less specialty malts used in the mash. Draft will be going out to select wholesalers in PA, NJ, FL, and MD.â€ 70+ IBUâ€™s.
Magic Hat's seasonal Lager is also called Vinyl
An unfiltered and 100% bottle-conditioned version of 90 Minute IPA that's dry-hopped with Palisade, Amarillo, Simcoe, Cascade, CTZ, and Willamette hops. Brewed to honor the Rogue Gallery in Portland, Maine, who will also be releasing a DFH designed clothing line in the summer of '09.
For the 28th session of the Harpoon 100 Barrel Series, weâ€™re celebrating this yearâ€™s hop harvest with Glacier Harvest Wet Hop beer, a pale ale made with fresh Glacier hops.
 
Wet hop beers are brewed using fresh, â€œwetâ€ hops instead of traditional dried hopsâ€”hops contain about 60% moisture when they are first picked.

Typically, when hops are picked they are quickly dried and refrigerated to increase shelf life and make them more consistent for brewing. Freshly picked wet hops, however, need to be used within hours of harvest or they will begin to degrade rapidly. Wet hops retain more of their natural aroma and volatile flavors that dissipate when dried. This gives wet hop beers a fresher hop flavor and aroma than that of beers hopped with processed hops.
This yields an immersed, intense hop flavor in the beer.

Harpoon brewer Ray Dobens, creator of the beer, added a heroic dose of fresh hops the day of the harvest.The hop flavor and aroma from this copper-colored ale comes from a generous late addition of freshly harvested â€œwetâ€ hops.
Born of Irish tradition, this all-malt ale uses kilned and toasted malts to produce its all-natural, signature red shade. A beer with exceptional balance, Irish Red displays an initial sweetness that fades to a clean, dry finish.
Our 13th Anniversary Beer in was a Staff Favorite, So We Make it Each Year. BIG on the Amarillo Hops and Rich Dark Malts for a Round and Huge, Smoky Flavor.
Jet-black in color, this monster smells of coffee and chocolate.  The taste is much of the same, with hints of creamy toffee and roasted malt.  Smooth and delicious, this medium bodied ale is all about the malts, but has enough hop bitterness to be balanced.
The name Vigneronne Cantillon was given in 1987. This name reminds us that, while it belongs to the beer patrimony, the spontaneous fermentation, the ageing in the barrels for several years and the addition of grapes make it a distant cousin of certain white wines.

In spite of its success, the Vigneronne represents less than 5% of the total production of the Cantillon brewery. In order to obtain grapes which are as mature as possible, we buy them at the end of the season. Every year, 1000 kilos of white italian grapes are delivered at the Cantillon brewery in the beginning of October.
The fourth stop on our multi-year trip to explore New Jersey takes us to one of the most maligned places in the state- the Hackensack Meadowlands. Itâ€™s the place usually identified with landfills, pipelines, mob burials (alleged) and sports teams that say theyâ€™re from New York.

Although no longer home to forests of giant cedars and salt hay marshes teeming with aquatic life, the Meadowlands is still an amazingly diverse ecosystem providing vital animal and plant habitat. In a nod to a once common food plant here, weâ€™ve brewed this beer with wild rice. We also used brown and white rice, as well as two malts.

Rice helps the beer ferment dry to better showcase the five different hops weâ€™ve added. Lots and lots of them. We then dry-hopped this Double IPA with even more-generous additions of Chinook and Citra hops to create a nose that hints at tangerine, mango, papaya and pine.

It's big and full bodied with lots of roasted malts and balanced with heavy hops to put this imperial in a league of its own.
Southern Pecan Nut Brown Ale is the first beer in the world, to our knowledge, made with whole roasted pecans. The pecans are used just like grain and provide a nutty characteristic and a delightful depth to the flavor profile. This beer is very lightly hopped to allow the malty, caramel, and nutty flavors shine through. The color is dark mahogany. Southern Pecan won a Bronze Medal in the 2006 World Beer Cup in the Specialty Beer category.
In 750ml corked â€™nâ€™ caged bottles this will be and unfiltered, fully bottle conditioned version of the super popular Double Simcoe. Expect Cask taste in a bottle, with more pronounced hoppy flavor and aroma due to being unfiltered. Also, carbonation will be a bit higher as is usual in our cork n cage series in keeping with tradition. It all comes together to form a uniquely great experience for hopheads.
Brown ale aged in Pinot Noir wine barrels for one year with sour cherries, Brettanomyces yeast, and Lactobacillus & Pedicoccus bacteria.
A dry and stupendously hopped medium bodied Imperial IPA brewed with Canadian two-row malt, dextrose sugar and lots of American hops. Arctic Panzer Wolf has superior aromas of marmalade, white wine, pine and apricot all mixed with an intense American hop bitterness.
Free Loader Double Red IPA was "double-brewed". [How's that for a catchy term that those BiG brewers can't TouCH. I love it, LoVe it, LOVE it.] The first batch of red IPA was mashed, sparged, and transferred to the kettle. The second batch of red IPA was mashed, sparged and transferred to the kettle using the sweet wort from batch one as its mash "water". Hmmm...using "beer" to make beer. Hence the name FREE LOADER. This Double Red IPA is just that--big, red, hoppy.
This extreme Double Oatmeal Russian Imperial Stout will overwhelm, satisfy, and destroy your taste buds like no other!! D.O.R.I.S. is even darker, hoppier, and stronger than our gold medal winning B.O.R.I.S. The Crusher Stout. Dry hopped and first wort hopped and first wort hopped with the finest American hops for a great Imperial hops for a great Imperial Stout experience! Enjoy the darkness!
Some say â€œbigger is better!â€. At Hoppinâ€™ Frog, we built a massive hop dam to handle the enormous amount of hops added to this colossal American Triple I.P.A. An intense experience of citrus and piney hop character is complimented by layers of rich malt flavor. Behold our new standard for hoppy beers.
The essence of Christmas is captured in this very bottle you are holding. Perfectly blended spices compliment Frosted Frogâ€™s rich malt flavors, creating the ultimate Christmas experience. Celebrate the holidays as you savor this very special seasonal offering.
Special hoppy flavors and aromas are captured by adding freshly picked, undired hops during the harvest.

These wet hops impart a character unlike other brews, that is quite unique and satisfying for those who love hops â€“ the spice of beer. Smell the hop fields, smell the freshness.

To admit that the brewer at Half Pints is a bit of a hophead is an understatement. This India Pale Ale is unabashedly hoppy, not only from the Amarillo hops we add to the brew kettle, but also from the northwest U.S. variety called Cascade that we add directly to the final tank.

Try it with a curry or a basket of beer battered fish & chips. Serve in a glass at 8 degrees celcius. Unpasturized.
